Us geeks love our gadgets.  I had heard just bits and pieces about something called a Raspberry Pi.  I hadn't given much thought to it at first.  A brief glance at a web page or two but it didn't interest me at that time.  I was having a hard time picturing what I could do with it.  

What peaked my interest was a re-introduction to the Pi, and other similar devices, at Ruby Conf 2013 (Miami.)  The gadgets like the Raspberry Pi were used in some of the conference talks.  I also got hooked on the Sphero, but is another story.

After Ruby Conf I started researching the Pi some more.  I came across a site that seemed to have a lot about the Raspberry Pi, and other geek related topics - http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi/getstartedwithpi?ICID=getstartpi-videodoc5-getstartedlink

I watched some of the videos on the element14 site and my brain was invigorated.  The wheels started spinning.  So I ordered one of the Raspberry Pi Starter Pack.  In addition to the Pi, it came with a memory card, jumpers, USB WiFi, bread board, etc.  I grabbed mine from a site I found on the element14 page - http://www.adafruit.com/category/105  I added on the USB Wifi and a cool ruler.

I've only just begun to tinker with it, but so far it has been fun.  Using the NOOB tool, I loaded up a 4GB card with the Pi version of the XBMC. 

I plan on doing some more experimentation.  I picked up 4 new SD cards, two 8GB and two 16GB so I can try different loads and setups.  Plus I'm getting the kids involved so they can learn a little bit of geeky stuff.

Recommendation - grab a slice of pie, Raspberry Pi!
