    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I created my Digital Ocean VPS I setup SSH Keys for both my main laptop and desktop computers.  I grabbed the appropriate contents from my .pub file and pasted that information on the web form for &lsquo;Add SSH Key&rsquo; under the SSH Keys menu of my droplet.  However, I noticed that each time I would ssh to my server I would be required to input my password.</p>

<p>In this blog posting, I will illustrate how I solved this issue and why the word &lsquo;custom&rsquo; appears in the title.  There are many websites that cover how to setup passwordless ssh login.  For example, Digital Ocean has a nice posting: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2">here</a></p>

<p>However, those instructions, and other like it, assume a plain-vanilla setup.  Of course, I dare to be different.  For example, before I started to solve this puzzle, my ~/.ssh directory had the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>➜  .ssh  ls -la
</span><span class='line'>total 88
</span><span class='line'>drwx------  11 jfhogarty  staff   374 Jan  6 18:36 .
</span><span class='line'>drwxr-xr-x+ 93 jfhogarty  staff  3162 Jan  6 20:10 ..
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--@  1 jfhogarty  staff  6148 Mar  9  2013 .DS_Store
</span><span class='line'>-rw-------   1 jfhogarty  staff  1766 Mar  2  2013 id_rsa
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff   400 Mar  2  2013 id_rsa.pub
</span><span class='line'>-rw-------   1 jfhogarty  staff   668 Apr 20  2014 jh-mbp_id
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff   614 Apr 20  2014 jh-mbp_id.pub
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff  7162 Jan  5 21:17 known_hosts
</span><span class='line'>➜  .ssh</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The id_rsa (private file) and the id_rsa.pub (public file,) are your normal files one would find.  But I&rsquo;ve implemented a &lsquo;best-practice&rsquo; adopted from my day job and I create specific key files for different types of access.  For example, following the instructions in the link above, from the Digital Ocean article, I create the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>-rw-------   1 jfhogarty  staff   668 Jan  5 21:11 do_id_dsa
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff   614 Jan  5 21:11 do_id_dsa.pub</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you follow the steps from the link, there is one thing that you may need to do in addition to their steps.  Some systems require that you change the file permissions for the authorized_keys file located on your target computer.  For example, the following is how I have the permissions set on my VPS:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>➜  .ssh  ls -la
</span><span class='line'>total 12
</span><span class='line'>drwx------  2 jfhogarty jfhogarty 4096 Jan  5 21:16 .
</span><span class='line'>drwxr-xr-x 11 jfhogarty jfhogarty 4096 Jan  6 20:14 ..
</span><span class='line'>-rw-------  1 jfhogarty jfhogarty  614 Jan  5 21:14 authorized_keys
</span><span class='line'>➜  .ssh</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I adjusted the permissions using the following syntax:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>chmod 600 authorized_keys</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After creating the new keys on my laptop, and updating the authorized_keys file on the remote server, I thought surely I should now be able to login without using a password.  I was wrong!  The remote server continued to prompte me for my password.  I decided to call it a night as it was getting late.</p>

<p>While working on a VM issue today for my day job, my internal lightbulb went off and I realized what the problem was.  Lets take a fresh look at the .ssh directory of my laptop:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sh  ls -la
</span><span class='line'>total 88
</span><span class='line'>drwx------  11 jfhogarty  staff   374 Jan  6 18:36 .
</span><span class='line'>drwxr-xr-x+ 93 jfhogarty  staff  3162 Jan  6 20:21 ..
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--@  1 jfhogarty  staff  6148 Mar  9  2013 .DS_Store
</span><span class='line'>-rw-------   1 jfhogarty  staff   668 Jan  5 21:11 do_id_dsa
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff   614 Jan  5 21:11 do_id_dsa.pub
</span><span class='line'>-rw-------   1 jfhogarty  staff  1766 Mar  2  2013 id_rsa
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff   400 Mar  2  2013 id_rsa.pub
</span><span class='line'>-rw-------   1 jfhogarty  staff   668 Apr 20  2014 jh-mbp_id
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff   614 Apr 20  2014 jh-mbp_id.pub
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff  7162 Jan  5 21:17 known_hosts
</span><span class='line'>➜  .ssh</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The keen eye might notice that I now have three sets of private/public keys.  However, when I was typing ssh myhostname.com ssh didn&rsquo;t know which files to use, if any.  I was able to prove my theory by trying the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ssh -p 9986 -i ~/.ssh/do_id_dsa myhostname.com</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And BAM!  No password required to login.  I was on to a solution.  When I had my lightbulb moment, I had remembered that I needed to create a config file in the .ssh directory on my laptop.  Lets take a look at it:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>➜  .ssh  cat config
</span><span class='line'>Host 10.11.12.13
</span><span class='line'>IdentityFile ~/.ssh/do_id_dsa
</span><span class='line'>Protocol 2
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Host myhostname.com
</span><span class='line'>IdentityFile ~/.ssh/do_id_dsa
</span><span class='line'>Protocol 2
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>➜  .ssh</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>NOTE:  To protect the innocent, the IP Address and *.com name above are fake.  Please substitute those values for your real IP Address and/or domain name.</p>

<p>And that is how I solved my customized passwordless ssh access to my VPS.</p>

    <updated>2014-12-30T08:00:25-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/12/30/deploy-error-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been making progress with a personal application that I am working on.  In the early days of development, I had deployed a version of the application to Heroku &ndash; and it worked fine at that time.  Fast forward 6 months or so and lots of changes.  I deployed to Heroku and received an error when trying to view the website:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>heroku logs

<p>That error made no sense to me.  What the heck, I know the favicon.ico file exists, and why can&rsquo;t I get to the root path?  So I went to the rails console via heroku:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>heroku run rails console
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Running `rails console` attached to terminal... up, run.9397
</span><span class='line'>/app/app/models/connexion.rb:1:in `&lt;top (required)&gt;': superclass mismatch for class Nurny (TypeError)
</span><span class='line'>  from /app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.1.0/gems/activesupport-4.1.7/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:247:in `require'
</span><span class='line'>  from /app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.1.0/gems/activesupport-4.1.7/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:247:in `block in require'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that I am substituting my real class name with a bogus one, &lsquo;Nurny&rsquo;, for this example.</p>

<p>Ok, now I get an error that looks like a real error, though I didn&rsquo;t understand it.  Luckily this all occurred the night before our weekly morning Code and Coffee.  So I brought the issue up and Micah gave me a hand for a while, having me try different things.</p>

<p>The conflict only shows when trying to run in a production environment.  I had a model for &lsquo;Nurny&rsquo; that had a class defined of Nurny.  However, I also have a model concern, for queries, with a class of &lsquo;Nurny&rsquo; which was the cause of the issue.</p>

<p>So, now how can I fix this?  I tried a simple rename of the concern, changing the line:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>BEFORE
</span><span class='line'>class Nurny
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>AFTER
</span><span class='line'>class NurnyQry</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But that spurred a flurry of new problems.  Luckily I found another solution while thinking through this issue.  Why did the app work fine in a development rails environment, but not in production.  Now I must confess I&rsquo;m not sure if my solution will have a profound negative effect, but so far I have not encountered any issues.  The solution lies in the config/environments/production.rb file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>BEFORE:
</span><span class='line'>config.eager_load = true
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>AFTER:
</span><span class='line'>config.eager_load = false</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And that simple configuration change fixed my issue!</p>

    <updated>2014-11-18T08:40:25-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/11/18/aint-your-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When meeting new people in the programming community, we frequently share what we do in our day jobs.  By day I primarily use Perl, though I have been slowly building up an arsenal of Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications.  But before learning Matz&rsquo;s Ruby, I learned a different flavor of Ruby.  And this &lsquo;aint your ruby.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When I first transitioned to the team I am on now, my primary duties were to provide tier three support of specialized networking equipment.  Our team can be split into two roles:  Tech Support/Project Management and Automation/Programming.  Over time, I migrated over to the Automation side. We use Perl for our tool server scripts and Ruby to get things started.  Off to the internet I went to learn Ruby, only to quickly find that our Ruby was not the Ruby I found online.</p>

<p>The Ruby we use at work stands for:  <strong>R</strong>ules yo<strong>U B</strong>uild <strong>Y</strong>ourself.  I believe the foundation or underlaying language is Java.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, our networking equipment sends events/traps to a trap collector.  That collector then does some processing on the event and forwards to our Ruby system.  We then perform certain actions using our Ruby based on the received alarms/events.  Below is an example code of &lsquo;our&rsquo; Ruby:</p>

    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/11/17/Cha-Cha-Cha-Chruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I got a bug, ney rather an itch I needed to scratch.  I have been using RVM for over a year and half.  I have had some issues, but mostly those were due to me learning how to work with RVM.</p>

<p>I was having an odd issue on one of my Macs so I decided to remove RVM and install rbenv.  I shot a tweet out to see if anyone had an opinion about rbenv and I received a reply suggesting I give chruby a chance.  Recently I had listened to an episode of Ruby Rogues <a href="http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/169-rr-version-managers-with-michal-papis-mislav-maronic-and-postmodern-mod-iii">#169</a>,  where they talked about RVM, rbenv, and chruby.</p>

<p>So I decied to give chruby a try.  Removing RVM is pretty straight forward.  You should be able to simply run:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rvm implode</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once removed, you may need to edit your .bashrc/.zshrc or *profile file(s) to remove any reference to RVM.</p>

<p>While I really like RVM, I&rsquo;ve always been a bit worried about the magic it performs &ndash; the stuff it does for me that I&rsquo;m not familiar with.  Chruby seemed to be easier for me to grasp.  From my limited understanding, there seems to be less moving parts in chruby vs. RVM.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to lay out all of the steps to get chruby installed.  The source web pages for chruby and ruby-install are very easy to read and comprehend.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby">chruby</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install">ruby-install</a></p>

<p>It took me a little bit to understand the differences of chruby and how I would use in my environment.  But after getting it running on my laptop, I converted two other Macs, my Ubuntu VM, and my CentOS server to use chruby.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, I do like RVM, and it had served me well.  I still use RVM at my day job on our CentOS servers.  I thought changing from RVM to chruby on those servers would be a good idea, so I attempted to change a development server.  While the removal of RVM and install of Chruby went fine, I ran into a huge issue.  I could not get Passenger to work properly under Chruby.  I&rsquo;m sure the reason is due to my lack of understanding, but I just couldn&rsquo;t afford to figure it out. So I switched back to RVM &ndash; and RVM will stay on our work servers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have many learning tools in my arsenal including Code School, Thoughtbot/Upcase, RailsCasts, Ruby Tapas, and too many other Internet based free resources to list.  But today I want to talk tapas, and borrow something that I learned from watching many episodes of Ruby Tapas.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve watched various episodes, I kept saying to myself, how is Avdi executing code right from within his text editor?  Is this some time of post production trickery?  Perhaps a green screen based laptop with a dash of After Effects?  But after some research, I learned that is wasn&rsquo;t some fancy magic, but rather an ability within his editor.  I believe that editor to be Emacs.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a Sublime Text user, and slowly dabbling with Vim.  So off to the online oracles to see if I could find a solution that would work in Sublime.  I did indeed find some solutions that said they were doing what Avdi can do &ndash; even referencing that they had the same desire as me.  However, I was not successful with getting Sublime to work the way I was expecting.  After spending several hours trying to force it to work, I gave up.  And I had a thought &ndash; surely this would be easier to get working with Vim.  :)</p>

<p>Getting the Tapas style in-line Ruby code execution to work in Vim was nice and easy.  I followed the instructions <a href="http://commandercoriander.net/blog/2012/10/10/evaluate-lines-of-ruby-in-vim/">here</a> and was up in running with very little effort.  For those that don&rsquo;t want leave from this fabulous reading, I&rsquo;ll summarize what needs to be done, first starting with the installation of a gem:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem install rcodetools</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we need to add a plugin to Vim.  Depending on your setup, you may need to add the .vim/bundle directory in your home directory.  But I already had this setup, so all I needed to do was the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cd ~
</span><span class='line'>cd .vim/bundle
</span><span class='line'>git clone https://github.com/t9md/vim-ruby-xmpfilter.git</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For a final bit of setup/configuration, we need to take a trip in editing the ~/.vimrc or ~/.vimrc.local file so we can do some mapping:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>nmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F4&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-mark)
</span><span class='line'>xmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F4&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-mark)
</span><span class='line'>imap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F4&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-mark)
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>nmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F5&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-run)
</span><span class='line'>xmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F5&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-run)
</span><span class='line'>imap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F5&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-run)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The above mapping will allows us to mark (F4) what line(s) we want to see the results for of executing the ruby code, which we accomplish by pressing F5.  Let&rsquo;s step through an example to see how this works.  I&rsquo;ll show the example file through the various stages.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>1 class Person
</span><span class='line'>2   attr_accessor :name, :age
</span><span class='line'>3
</span><span class='line'>4   def initialize(name)
</span><span class='line'>5     self.name = name
</span><span class='line'>6     self.age = "Does it matter?"
</span><span class='line'>7   end
</span><span class='line'>8 end
</span><span class='line'>9
</span><span class='line'>10 p = Person.new('Kevin')
</span><span class='line'>11 p.name
</span><span class='line'>12 p.age</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next we will press F4 for the code we want to evaluate, line 11 below:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>1 class Person
</span><span class='line'>2   attr_accessor :name, :age
</span><span class='line'>3
</span><span class='line'>4   def initialize(name)
</span><span class='line'>5     self.name = name
</span><span class='line'>6     self.age = "Does it matter?"
</span><span class='line'>7   end
</span><span class='line'>8 end
</span><span class='line'>9
</span><span class='line'>10 p = Person.new('Kevin')
</span><span class='line'>11 p.name # =&gt;
</span><span class='line'>12 p.age</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And finally, EXECUTE (F5):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>1 class Person
</span><span class='line'>2   attr_accessor :name, :age
</span><span class='line'>3
</span><span class='line'>4   def initialize(name)
</span><span class='line'>5     self.name = name
</span><span class='line'>6     self.age = "Does it matter?"
</span><span class='line'>7   end
</span><span class='line'>8 end
</span><span class='line'>9
</span><span class='line'>10 p = Person.new('Kevin')
</span><span class='line'>11 p.name # =&gt; "Kevin"
</span><span class='line'>12 p.age</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Pretty neat, eh?  Borrowing this workflow from Ruby Tapas will now help me when I&rsquo;m following along with each episode.  Now I just need to get better with Vim.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most of my Rails projects, for personal use and education, have been using Postgresql or SQLite for the datbase backend.  At work our primary database is Oracle with a dash of MySQL.  Recently we decided to use MySQL with all future development, and migrate our tools/applications that use Oracle to use MySQL.</p>

<p>I downloaded and installed MySQL by grabbing the installer from the MySQL website:  <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/</a> and getting the version for my operating system &ndash; OS X Mavericks.</p>

<p>However, with this version installed I was having issues with bundler and getting the mysql gem to compile.  I tried a few solutions that I found on the internet, but none of them were working.</p>

<p>I found some other people who had issues, when using OSX Mavericks, with the MySQL installer.  They solved the issue by removing MySQL that was installed from the download via dev.mysql.com and then re-installing using Homebrew.</p>

<p>This solution worked for me as well.  I found this a bit odd, because earlier in the year I had issues with installing Postgres via Homebrew.  The solution for Postgres was to remove the Homebrew installation and use the installer from the Postgres site.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/10/27/brew-a-fix-for-imagemagick-and-paperclip/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-27T18:05:25-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/10/27/brew-a-fix-for-imagemagick-and-paperclip</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While working on a Rails project last week I encountered an issue where some of my tests were failing.  It had been a while since I worked on this project so I had to re-familiarize myself with what was going on.</p>

<p>The tests were failing when editing a profile and adding an image.  I popped over to the browser and performed a manual test to get a better idea of what was going on.  That is when I saw the following error: <em>&ldquo;Paperclip::Errors::NotIdentifiedByImageMagickError&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>To attempt to fix the issue, I first performed a simple uninstall and re-install of imagemagic using homebrew:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>brew uninstall imagemagick
</span><span class='line'>brew install imagemagick</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This didn&rsquo;t solve the problem.  Imagemagic has a command line utility, convert, which one can use to see if the application is working.  I tried a simple test:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>convert moonie.jpg moon.png</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But I continued to get errors even with that simple test.  So off to the internet for some deep research.  I came across the following steps, which solved the issue I was having.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>brew update
</span><span class='line'>brew doctor
</span><span class='line'>brew uninstall libtool
</span><span class='line'>brew uninstall imagemagic
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>cd /Library/Caches/Homebrew
</span><span class='line'>rm imagemag*
</span><span class='line'>rm libtool-2.4.2.tar.gz
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>brew doctor
</span><span class='line'>brew install libtool --universal
</span><span class='line'>brew link libool --force
</span><span class='line'>brew install imagemagic --build-from-source</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After completing the above steps, the command line tool, convert was successful.  I re-tested the Rails application, both manually, and via my test suite, and all was green again.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/testing-to-csv-method/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-23T09:32:37-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/testing-to-csv-method</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I covered a topic that resurfaced while I am in the process of upgrading one of our apps from Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.x. When I wrote that application I was a raw recruit &ndash; fresh to Ruby and Rails and just trying to get the idea to work.</p>

<p>But as I&rsquo;ve been improving my skills and expanding the ole grey matter, I wanted to write this new version, fully tested.  In the application there is a need to be able to export the data to a CSV formatted file.  I had the code from the old version of the app, and migrated it over.  However, I challenged myself to figure out how to write a test for the to_csv method in Baytech model.</p>

<p>Below is the code from the Baytech model:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def self.to_csv
</span><span class='line'>  CSV.generate(col_sep: ':') do |csv|
</span><span class='line'>    all.each do |baytech|
</span><span class='line'>      port = "X"
</span><span class='line'>      csv &lt;&lt; [baytech.name, baytech.phone_num, baytech.ip_addr, port, baytech.modem_type, port]
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I know the method works, as it has been working fine for 9 months or so now.  But I really wanted to figure out how to write a test for this method.  After much trial and error, along with research via books and google, I came up with the following solution:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>describe Baytech, '#to_csv' do
</span><span class='line'>  let(:baytech) { FactoryGirl.create(:baytech) }
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  before do
</span><span class='line'>    baytech
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  it { expect(Baytech.to_csv).to match /#{baytech.name}:#{baytech.phone_num}:#{baytech.ip_addr}:X:1:X/ }
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You may notice in the above code that I am referencing a Factory.  Here is a short version of that factory file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>FactoryGirl.define do
</span><span class='line'>  factory :baytech do
</span><span class='line'>    sequence(:name) {|n| "jaxfl0#{n}b9" }
</span><span class='line'>    sequence(:ip_addr) {|n| "10.1.2.#{n}" }
</span><span class='line'>    phone_num "7091234384"
</span><span class='line'>    region "USA"
</span><span class='line'>    modem_type "1"
</span><span class='line'>    ip_method "ssh"
</span><span class='line'>    active true
</span><span class='line'>    has_modem_line true
</span><span class='line'>    updated_by "cd1234"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    {-snip-}
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The keen eye may have caught something interesting in the to_csv method.  I&rsquo;m using an option, col_sep: &lsquo;:&rsquo; which allows me to use the : character as the delimiter instead of the default comma.</p>

<p>With the test in place, and passing, I felt better about the code in my to_csv method.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/09/16/reflect-on-inflectors/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-16T08:26:35-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/09/16/reflect-on-inflectors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I re-discovered an issue I ran into about 8 months ago.  I am re-writing an application I created for work.  The first version was written in Ruby 1.9.x and Rails 3.x.  I built the app using sticks and glue &ndash; no testing.</p>

<p>We are migrating to Ruby 2.1.x and Rails 4.1.x and rather than copy over the app and tweak it, I wanted to take a better approach, a TDD approach.</p>

<p>It is a pretty simple application, with two main models &ndash; Baytech and Device.  A Baytech can have zero to many devices, and a device should only belong to one baytech.</p>

<p>To frameout my two models I used the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rails g model baytech
</span><span class='line'>rails g model device</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Everything seemed fine at first.  Until I started writing tests and code then I re-discovered a blast from the past.  What I didn&rsquo;t catch was that Rails, with its vast knowledge, pluralized both baytech and device as:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>bayteches</li>
<li>devices</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, all is cool with the plural version of device as devices.  But the plural of baytech is baytechs.  Oh crap, what do I do?</p>

<p>The first time this happened to me, it took me a while to figure out what the heck was going on.  Eventually all roads led me to the file config/initializers/inflections.rb</p>

<p>Taking a look inside this file, I found the following, or something similar:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
</span><span class='line'># are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
</span><span class='line'># locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
</span><span class='line'># ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, '\1en'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, '\1'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.irregular 'person', 'people'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.uncountable %w( fish sheep )
</span><span class='line'># end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
</span><span class='line'># ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.acronym 'RESTful'
</span><span class='line'># end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To cure my issue, I had to make one small change to this file, making use of inflect.irregular:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>  inflect.irregular 'baytech', 'baytechs'
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once that change was made, anytime there was a need for the plural version of baytech, Rails knew to use baytechs.  Yeah!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently had the joy of installing Oracle 11g Express Edition on my home server.  That server runs CentOS 6.x as that is the flavor of Linux we use at my day job.  The server install is another story I will cover in the future, but today I would like to share how I got my laptop and development environment setup to connect to the Oracle Database.</p>

<p>Why in the world would I want to use Oracle you ask?  Well I don&rsquo;t really want to.  However, at the day job, that is what we use. And I wanted a more flexible development environment.  Due to limited resources, our &lsquo;dev&rsquo; database is also our disaster recovery database.  &lsquo;Nuff said?</p>

<p>In order to get my ruby environment setup to work with this monster database, I need two gems:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter', '~&gt; 1.5.0'
</span><span class='line'>gem 'ruby-oci8', '~&gt; 2.1.0'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a href="https://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced">Oracle Enhanced</a></p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself.  Lets take two steps back.</p>

<h2>Download some files</h2>

<p>On my server I have installed Oracle 11g Express, and my laptop is fairly current and run OS X Mavericks &ndash; a 64bit Operating System.  So let&rsquo;s get the appropriate client.</p>

<p>Download the required files from the Oracle Download site:
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/intel-macsoft-096467.html">Oracle Client</a></p>

<p>Note:  The following was learned by reviewing the blog over at: <a href="http://blog.codiez.co.za/2013/09/setup-oracle-instant-client-ruby-oci8-gem-mac/">codiez</a></p>

<p>For me, I downloaded these files:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>instantclient-sqlplus-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>instantclient-sdk-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Change to the directory where you downloaded the files
(e.g. cd Downloads &ndash; assuming you are in your home directory)</p>

<p>Unzip the three files:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-sqlplus-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-sdk-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Change directories to the new one created by the unzipping:
cd instantclient_11_2</p>

<p>Perform the following steps:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>mv * /usr/local/oracle/product/instantclient_64/11.2.0.4.0/bin/</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, we need to create and modify the tnsnames.org file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir -p /usr/local/oracle/admin/network
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>touch /usr/local/oracle/admin/network/tnsnames.ora
</span><span class='line'>vim /usr/local/oracle/admin/network/tnsnames.ora
</span><span class='line'>rubyrailssvr =
</span><span class='line'>  (DESCRIPTION =
</span><span class='line'>    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 192.168.1.14)(PORT = 1521))
</span><span class='line'>    (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVICE_NAME = XE))
</span><span class='line'>  )
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>rubyrailssvr.homenet.com =
</span><span class='line'>  (DESCRIPTION =
</span><span class='line'>    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 192.168.1.14)(PORT = 1521))
</span><span class='line'>    (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVICE_NAME = XE))
</span><span class='line'>  )</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we need to get our environment setup. Create a .oracle_client file in your home directory:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>touch ~/.oracle_client
</span><span class='line'>vim ~/.oracle_client
</span><span class='line'>export ORACLE_BASE=/usr/local/oracle
</span><span class='line'>export ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/instantclient_64/11.2.0.4.0
</span><span class='line'>export PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
</span><span class='line'>export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
</span><span class='line'>export TNS_ADMIN=$ORACLE_BASE/admin/network
</span><span class='line'>export SQLPATH=$ORACLE_HOME/sqlplus/admin</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I use the bash shell at work, but have been working with zsh at home lately.  So below I show how to add the above oracle environment variables to both bash and zsh:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>echo "source ~/.oracle_client" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</span><span class='line'>source ~/.bash_profile
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>echo "source ~/.oracle_client" &gt;&gt; ~/.zprofile
</span><span class='line'>source ~/.zprofile</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Optional step &ndash; if needed, you may need to update your /etc/hosts file so that you can resolve the IP address of your server to a fully qualified domain name.  See the following example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>192.168.1.14    rubyrailssvr.homenet.com</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We are almost there &ndash; go take a break if you need to.  Before we update our Gemfile to add the two gems I listed earlier, let&rsquo;s first test and make sure we can connect.  We will use sqlplus to perform that test, which is a tool that was installed as part of the instant client.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>➜  ~  sqlplus system@192.168.1.14
</span><span class='line'>

<p>You should be able to connect now, though I have made a huge assumption.  I have assumed that your Oracle DB is currently configured to accept remote connections.</p>

<p>Well that wraps up todays episode.  Get out there and &hellip;</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/07/24/wrap-up-bloc/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-24T12:05:14-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/07/24/wrap-up-bloc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been bad.  I let myself get consumed by my attendance of the on-line course at Bloc, and spending a lot of after-work-hours working on my personal project.  I have neglected my writing, and I apologize for my absence.</p>

<p>Earlier today I received notification from Disquis that someone, Nalani, had submitted a comment.  I am grateful for that comment as it reminded me of absence from this blog.  So with that nice kick-in-the-pants, let&rsquo;s move forward.</p>

<p>I completed my on-line training of the Bloc.io course on June 9th 2014.  Overall I was satisfied with the training and can confidently recommend it to others, depending on their situation.  What?</p>

<p>Bloc is not for everyone.  The first barrier to overcome is the cost.  I believe I got in before the price increase so the tuition was around $4250 if memory serves me correctly.  I believe the price to be fair for what you get.  However, I would not suggest that anyone plop down that money if they are currently struggling financially.</p>

<p>Depending on your employment needs, Bloc may not be for you.  For me, I took the course to better my programming skills and to assist me move forward with my personal project.  But I would not say that what I learned would allow me to get a job similar to what I have now, at my current pay rate.  I think the education would help one land a junior-developer job or an internship at a dev shop.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert, but from my experience with local dev shops here, there is a heavy emphasis on testing and Test-Drive-Development(TDD.)  And when I took the Bloc course, that area was lacking.  You can see my previous post for more information.</p>

<p>Yesterday I received an email from Bloc that indicated that they improving the Full Stack program by adding more testing to the course.  Not sure if it was my feedback, or feedback from many of us past students, but I&rsquo;m glad to see that they continuously improve on their product.</p>

<p>Is Bloc for you?  Maybe.  If you are like me, someone who has a day job and wanted to improve their programming skills, while trying to bring your product idea to life, then yes.  Maybe you are someone with a great idea, a founder, and want to get a better grip on what it will take to produce your product.  I think Bloc can help you there.  If you are trying to break ground in the industry and land your first job or internship, then yes, I think Bloc is for you.  If you need the extra hand holding while learning the basics, then yes I think you will get value from the Bloc program.</p>

<p>I do want to end with a note about the mentorship, and you may have read into my words at the end of the last paragraph.  If you are seeking what I consider advance knowledge and/or assistance, you may be dissapointed.  While I found the mentorship to be very helpful at the beginning and middle of my training, I was dissapointed at the end when it came to my capstone project.  Fortunately for me, about 8 weeks in to my Bloc training, I met a guy, Shaun, who became my &lsquo;external-mentor.&rsquo;  If not for him, I would not have been able to complete some of the Bloc assignments the way I wanted &ndash; via TDD.  Sure I could have completed them, but I want to develop by writing tests first.  Shaun has also helped me with my personal project and taken it so much farther than I could have done on my own.  What I&rsquo;m trying to end with is this &ndash; no matter if you take the training at Bloc or else where, find a mentor who will spend the time with you to help you learn.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/05/11/enter-the-4th-block/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-11T18:05:24-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/05/11/enter-the-4th-block</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Picking up from where I left off with my block experience (see previous post, Week 2 and a half at Bloc,) a lot of good things, and some bad things, have occurred.  I had finished, what was called at the time, the third block, which included lessons on RSpec, Testing Users and both creating and destroying using Ajax.</p>

<p>The end of Block Three took me a bit longer to complete compared to how I progressed through the first two blocks.  The material in the third block was new to me.  It was during the end of this block, and creeping into the beginning of block four that I began to have issues with my mentor.  In the first two blocks, since I didn&rsquo;t need much help, I didn&rsquo;t mind that our sessions tended to be brief.  Usually they ran up to 10 minutes.  But our sessions are booked for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>My mentor during this time had missed a some meetings and had asked me to reschedule a few times.  I&rsquo;m flexible so I didn&rsquo;t see an issue.  But there was one time that I needed to reschedule and the mentor wouldn&rsquo;t work with me to make up the time.  Time much needed as I was having trouble with the project I had selected in Block Four &ndash; Saas Wiki Collaboration Tool.  I was getting very frustrated.</p>

<p>I reached out to student coordinator at Bloc, Karen, and discussed the issues I was having.  I explained that in the beggining I had gotten ahead, but now with all the problems I was encountering with this mentor, I was getting behind.  And I felt it very disrepectful that I was asked on several occasions to modify my schedule for him, but the one time I needed a re-schedule, he didn&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>Karen helped me out and let me pick out a new mentor.  She said that they would add a week to my enrollment to help make up for some of the lost time.  (Think I need to check on that because it doesn&rsquo;t look like they added a week.)  The new mentor, Charlie, was a huge improvment.  Never did I feel like he was trying to get me off the phone.  In fact, on several calls we went over the scheduled 30 minutes.</p>

<p>While working with the new mentor, Charlie, has been a much better experience, I feel that there is something missing from the program.  Although it is said that students will do pair programming and testing, I don&rsquo;t find either to come near what I was expecting.  It may be that my expectations are set to high from what the folks at Bloc had planned to offer.  I can understand that they have a range of differently skilled students.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m far off in saying that most newbies to this program probably don&rsquo;t care as much about testing as I do.</p>

<p>I find this mediocre approach to testing to transcend into the help one would get in the Office Hours Chat room.  I&rsquo;ll provide a brief example.  I was stuck on how to write a test that would make sure that any user, other than a logged in user, would not be able to access the ability to upgrade a users account by direct url navigation.  When I posed my question the answer I got was that I should use Pundit&rsquo;s policies and don&rsquo;t display the upgrade button unless the user is logged in and allowed to upgrade.</p>

<p>I had explained that I had already written tests for that, and the code to make the tests green, but I wanted to ensure that a malicous user would not be able to access the url for an upgrade directly.  The short answer I got was &ldquo;&hellip;well the users shouldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;  Yeah, well credit card thieves should not steal peoples credit card info and identies either, but I&rsquo;m sure the credit card companies do whatever they can to protect against those thieves.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t think the program was meant to take testing as seriously as I am.  It seems the program gives one just enough to say, &ldquo;&hellip; yeah I know how to test with RSpec.&rdquo;  Although I&rsquo;m happy with my mentor Charlie, I felt a bit frustrated on our calls when trying to work through testing issues.  So frustrated in fact that I stopped testing the proper way and just worked on trying to complete the assignment.</p>

<p>Bloc changed the student dashboard and I got really worried.  I was reviewing where I was in the program and the dashboard was telling me that I was behind.  The dashboard lists 5 projects, including the one I was working on, Saas Wiki Collaboration.  The sixth project is for our capstone.  Seeing that I had only four weeks left, and still hadn&rsquo;t finished this Wiki project, I got a bit frazzled.  It is not like I haven&rsquo;t been putting in the time!</p>

<p>On my mentoring call with Charlie last Friday I asked what the deal was.  There was no way I could finish all those projects and have time for my capstone.  My previous mentor had said that I only needed to pick one if I wanted to spend more time on the capstone project.  Luckily, Charlie confirmed that the dashboard was a bit confusing.  Students have the option to do more than one project before their capstone, but it is not required.</p>

<p>That made me feel a bit better, but I still needed to wrap up this Wiki project.  The main reason I took this course was to work on my capstone and have help when/where I needed via the mentorship and Office Hours Chat room.  Please don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I have learned a lot via the program, but my main goal is to work on my personal project.</p>

<p>With some &lsquo;external&rsquo; help, I was able to wrap up this Wiki project.  At least I believe it to be done according to the original requirements.  I even was able to get the Stripe intergration to work, with tests!  I&rsquo;ll have another blog post regarding the external help &ndash; stay tuned!</p>

<p>I have another mentoring call on Monday &ndash; 05/12/14.  We should be able to discuss my capstone project and get an idea of how to get started.  The nice thing about the Saas Wiki project is that there are a lot of components of that app which will apply to my capstone project.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more information regarding my experience at <a href="http://www.bloc.io">Bloc.io</a>  I will be publishing an overview of the program at the conclusion of enrollment.</p>

    <updated>2014-04-17T22:10:08-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/17/3-noobs-at-lillys</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This evening I attended the RubyJax OpenHacks event at Lilly&rsquo;s Cafe out at the beach.  I believe the normal schedule has the OpenHacks event on the third Thursday of each month.  I like to get to th event a bit early as parking in that area can be a royal pain.</p>

<p>Shortly after I settled in, another new guy to the group, Jesse, joined me.  I had met Jesse a previous week at one of the Code &amp; Coffee events.  We got to talk a little bit about ourselves and what we were trying to accomplish in our quest of learning.</p>

<p>Enter the third n00b, Josh.  I was starting wonder if Micah has set the three of us in a fun game of snipe hunting.  Get all the new people together and laugh at them from a distance.  :)  The three of chatter a bit back and forth for a while, sharing some of our experiences.</p>

<p>One can learn from others that are new to Ruby, or anything for that matter.  For example, Jesse shared a neat tool he was using with me called Dash (<a href="http://kapeli.com/dash">http://kapeli.com/dash</a>).  This is a neat little app that sources the documentation of too many to count languages and frameworks.  I downloaded the app while he was demonstrating, and was excited to see all of the reference material available for the subjects I was interested in.  And then some!</p>

<p>I shared my current experience with Bloc.io and demonstrated their website, including a sample of some of the lessons I had completed and the one I had just started &ndash; my big project.  About this time Michah had showed up and I know that at least I felt at ease.  Micah had helped me before with some learning and I was hoping to pick his brain again.</p>

<p>Before we get to that though, Josh took a turn at sharing some resources.  The one that really stuck out to me was this website:  <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/">http://gitimmersion.com/</a>  I found this site to be a great resource, for the beginner, in learning how to use git.  So far I&rsquo;ve made it up to lab 14.  What I find really useful about this site is that I will be able to use the lessons on the site to help educate my fellow team workers at my day job.  Trying hard to get us all to use version control.</p>

<p>Just at I was getting ready to ask Micah a question, we had another join our group.  I was surprised, but very please to see Paolo Perrota join our group.  I think it is safe to say that all of use new guys were very happy to be hanging with two Ruby Gurus.</p>

<p>Rounding out the evening I reached out for some help with a coding issue I was having.  For the OOB Web app that I&rsquo;ve been developing for the day job, I need to support an older app.  This app uses the same data that I&rsquo;m migrating to the web app.  But the data in the files that support the app need to be delimited with a : and contain fields that we no longer need.  I had been able to figure out how to build that information as a : delimited export via the browser, but what I really needed was a rake task that could build two text files.</p>

<p>Working with Micah, he showed me where I was doing things correctly, and where I was making some mis-steps.  Using his guidance I was able to finish writing my second rake job &ndash; exporting the data.  I don&rsquo;t recall if I have mentioned it before, but Micah also helped me construct my first rake job &ndash; importing the data.</p>

<p>The time at Lilly&rsquo;s flew by, but I&rsquo;m confident in saying that all of us newbies learned something useful.  Looking forward to the next Code &amp; Coffee and OpenHacks events.</p>

    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/07/ancient-city-ruby-2014-day-two</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Day two was a rough start for me.  I over slept a little bit so I didn&rsquo;t have time to get breakfast at home.  Luckily, there was some breakfast provided at the conference.  I&rsquo;m not a big carb eater, but I knew that if I didn&rsquo;t eat something, it would be a rough day.  So down went a half bagel, some fruit, a glass of water and a coffee chaser.</p>

<p>Starting out the day was someone I had heard of, but never met &ndash; Terence Lee.  Terence works at Heroku as well as participates on the Ruby core team as a contributor.  I enjoyed this talk because I&rsquo;ve been using Heroku in my knowledge quest and found the topic to be relevant.  I think we sometimes take for granted what is going on behind the scenes, by guys like Terence, to ensure easy deployment of our apps.  In summary &ndash; make sure you are off of Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2.</p>

<p>For day two, I took the most notes during the second talk by Craig Kerstiens.  He talked about Postgres which is the primary database that I&rsquo;ve been using in my Rails applications.  Craig confirmed something that I had encountered two days earlier &ndash; don&rsquo;t use homebrew for Postgres.  Download and use the Postgres.app from their website.  I had a lot of issues during my workshop due to homebrew and its installation of Postgres.  Along with good tips for Postgres related resources, I also learned new stuff like sequential scan vs index scan.  And using Gin for indexing when you have multiple values in a column vs the standard BTree index method.  Rounding out his talk, I walked away with a to-do list of required research on HStore and jsonb.</p>

<p>Lunch on day two was the only part of the conference I didn&rsquo;t like.  I am not a pasta fan at all and sadly didn&rsquo;t find much I could eat.  I ended up snacking on two pieces of cheese and a chunk of bread.  Where the meal failed for me, the desert was a home run!  So I filled up on desert and coffee.  Yup, I was a bit jittery for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>After lunch it was time for Aaron.  His presentation had both a healthy serving of comedic relief as well as filling geekery.  Who else but Aaron would code a way, using a webcam, to scan all of his Magic the Gathering cards and catalog their value?  Oh and did I mention there were cats?  Aaron urged the audience to help him test out one of his projects related to OpenCV.  We were to all send him a tweet with the words &ldquo;Photo Me&rdquo;.  The goal was for his program to see the tweet, take a picture of Aaron at that moment in time, and send the picture to the person who tweeted him.  Well it seems one variable wasn&rsquo;t accounted for &ndash; Twitter.  With a flood of incoming requests to his Twitter account, the &ldquo;enforcers&rdquo; locked his account.</p>

<p>Something that I had forgotten to mention earlier was that for most of the conference, Ben sat with me.  I really thought this was cool.  Most of the speakers sat together up front or to the side.  But I got to sit with Ben &ndash; just me and him.</p>

<p>Which brings me to one of Ben&rsquo;s friends &ndash; Konstantin.  Ben had made some reference to Konstantin in his presentation &ndash; well more like to Konstantin&rsquo;s bag which apparently got lost while enroute to a conference in the Philippines.  Konstantin had a good bit of humor in his presentation which focused on security.  It was very englightening to learn about the many different ways hackers try to compromise web applications, including Rails applications.  Both the Ruby and Rails teams make a great effort to eliminate/prevent security issues.  I&rsquo;ll admit there were parts of the talk that went over my head.  But overall, I found it very usefull and an area where I want to learn more.</p>

<p>Near the end of Konstantin&rsquo;s talk I started to feel the effect of not eating a proper lunch, and an overload of sweets.  I started getting a little light-headed.  So the end of the conference was a bit of a blur.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been to two Ruby related conferences &ndash; Ruby Conf 2013 in Miami, and now this one, Ancient City Ruby Conf 2014.  Although the one if Miami was much larger, I enjoyed the Ancient City one more.  I felt like I learned more at ACR and fit in better.  At the conference in Miami I very much felt like an outsider.  But at ACR I met a lot of people from all over the US and the world.  I am looking forward to another Ancient City Ruby conference in 2015!</p>

    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/06/ancient-city-ruby-2014-day-one</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The actual conference was split across two days, and followed the single-track format.  This was unlike my experience at Ruby Conf 2013 &ndash; Miami, which was multiple topics going on concurrently.  For the first day, the following speakers were lined up:  Leon Gersing, Justin Searls, David Copeland, Katrina Owen, Richard Schneeman, and Ben Lovell.  Of all those speakers, I only had ever heard of three, and as it so happened, met each one of them: Justin Searls, Katrina Owen and Ben Lovell.</p>

<p>In a quick summary of the day, I wrote the most notes from the talk by Leon, learned the most from Katrina&rsquo;s talk and laughed my ass off, and learned some stuff, from Ben&rsquo;s talk.  Justin talk also had my interest and I had jotted down some notes from his presentation.</p>

<p>I really liked Leon&rsquo;s talk as to me it was not directly programming/developer related, but more so a spiritual and inspirational discussion.  I don&rsquo;t know if it was planned this way, but I believe it was perfectly executed as the first talk of the day &ndash; really set a good mood and environment.  Something that Leon said really moved me.  He said: &ldquo;Twitter, Facebook, Instagram are all simulations of relationships.&rdquo;  I thought that was very powerful.</p>

<p>Before I continue, I just want to say that I enjoyed all of the talks from the speakers on this day.  But given my current skill level with Ruby and as a programmer, some of the talks were more moving and relevant to me.  I&rsquo;m sure others had similar, but different results.</p>

<p>Three speakers in, some brief talks by some sponsors as well as lightening talks, and it was time for lunch.  I really enjoyed the lunch that was provided at the hotel for the conference.  Not only was the meal yummy, but the deserts were great as well.</p>

<p>On a nice full stomach, with a big smile on my face, it was time for Katrina&rsquo;s talk.  I really enjoy her presentation style and I feel that the delivery was at a level that I was able to absorb.  Katrina took us through a refactoring session for &ldquo;Bob.&rdquo;  Frightenly, some of that code looked familiar :)  If you get a chance, you can check out her prentation at: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kytrinyx/overkill">Overkill</a></p>

<p>Being the last speaker on a given day is a tough task.  People tend to start getting tired.  Leave it to Ben to fire up the crowd.  He had all of us rolling with laughter from his opening remarks to his closing arguments.  And along the way we learned a bit about testing APIs.  Watch out for those &ldquo;f#$@ing sharks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Day one didn&rsquo;t actually end after Ben&rsquo;s talk.  That evening some of the conference attendees went on the Ghost Ride, while the rest of us got to do the Pirate Ship adventure.  Even though I live in Jacksonville, which isn&rsquo;t too far from St. Augustine, I had not ever been on the Pirate Ship.  It was a lot of fun.  I just wish that I had my heavier hoodie and it got a bit cold on the water.  On the ship I got to meet a few other people from Hash Rocket, including Paul Elliott.  I had heard Paul&rsquo;s voice on several episodes of the Ruby5 podcast, and it was nice to meet him in person.</p>

<p>All-in-all, day one was a big hit for me.  Oh, I almost forgot!  At the beginning of the day, before the first talk started, I got to meet and shake hands with Aaron Patterson.  Yeah, you could say I&rsquo;m a fanboi of his.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/05/ancient-city-ruby-workshop/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-05T10:38:58-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/05/ancient-city-ruby-workshop</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my last post I discussed events prior to Ancient City Ruby 2014.  Now it is time to discuss my experience at the actual workshop and conference.  The conference part was spread across two days, Thursday and Friday, and there was an optional workshop day &ndash; Wednesday.  There were three different workshops offered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refactoring Rails by Katrina Owen</li>
<li>Rock@Vim by Jon Allured and Micah</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails: First Expedition by Beverly Nelson</li>
</ul>


<p>I had a tough decision to make.  I really wanted to attend Katrina&rsquo;s workshop, but I don&rsquo;t believe my skill set is good enough at this time to have been able to participate.  I thought that I&rsquo;d surely slow the class down.  On the other hand, I think I&rsquo;m beyond the Ruby on Rails: First Expedition level.  I am horrible at Vim, so it seemed obvious that I should sign up for the Rock@Vim workshop, and I did.</p>

<p>The Vim workshop was taught by two Hashrocket employees, Jon and Micah.  I&rsquo;d never met Jon before as he works out of the Chicago office.  But I have met Micah before, and he has helped me out a few times when I have gotten stuck or had questions.  Having some familiarity with a teacher was a plus.</p>

<p>I really wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect for the workshop, or how we would approach the topic.  I just want to get better at Vim.  Primarily, being better at vim would help at my day job as we ssh to most of our devices.  But I also want to try pair programming and from what I&rsquo;ve researched, one really needs to know vim.</p>

<p>The workshop started off good.  Jon and Micah introduced us to dotmatrix:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git clone https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix.git</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I don&rsquo;t know all the ins and outs but I guess I would summarize it as saying that by using dotmatrix I was able to configure my environment to by more &ldquo;HashRocketey&rdquo;  From the README.md file:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dotmatrix is a collection of dotfiles used at Hashrocket to customize various development tools. This project is the culmination of many years worth of tinkering with our favorite tools to get them to behave just right. We think using dotmatrix makes working with these tools more pleasant and hope you will too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were a few steps involved to get everything up and running, but I won&rsquo;t bore you with those details.  After the class was all setup, or at least we thought we were setup, we moved on to cloning a practice Rails project which we were going to use in our lessons for vim.</p>

<p>During part of the lesson I experienced an issue.  For some reason I was getting hung up with some issues involving Postgres.  I started to fall behind the class as I was trouble shooting.  Finally I just asked &ndash; &ldquo;&hellip; can I switch this project to SQLite to get beyond these problems?&rdquo;  Jon agreed that would be a good idea.  So I switched and tried to catch up.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t going well for me.  Working with my Postgres issue caused me to miss some key instructions and details that the rest of the class had observed.  Instead of fighting to try to figure things out, I just sat back and tried to focus.  I guess Micah saw that I was having some trouble so he came over to assist.  When I explained my situation he helped to get me back on track and also has Jon show me some stuff that helped to get me caught up.</p>

<p>At about the time I got caught up, we were quickly coming upon lunch time.  There was only four of us students plus Jon and Micah.  So we all went out to lunch together at A1A Ale Works.  It was a good time.  The advantage of a small class enabled us to be able to get to know each other and see what each others experience was like.</p>

<p>After lunch we were back at the brain fillage.  I was starting to get a bit tired, and it seemed like the topics were getting harder.  But we pressed on and learned some more neat things with using vim.  I learned enough during the workshop to make me want to learn more.  I will continue my vim learning, using what I absorbed in the workshop as a foundation, and utilize other resources like Vim Genius (<a href="http://vimgenius.com/">http://vimgenius.com/</a>) and the cool screencast series Vimcasts (<a href="http://vimcasts.org/">http://vimcasts.org/</a>).  Also, I picked up a copy of &ldquo;Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought,&rdquo; by Drew Neil who also produces the vimcasts.</p>

<p>Although I had some tough, frustrating moments, overall I enjoyed the Vim workshop.  Whether Jon knew it or not, he gave me a homework assignment.  As I was practicing at home that evening, I noticed that my prompt in the terminal was really long.  I prefer the following format:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>jfhogarty@Serenity:(source+*-)$</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So I had to figure out how to fix my prompt.  It wasn&rsquo;t too hard, just an edit to my ~/.bashrc file.  In my next post I will review my experience of the first day of the conference.  Stay tuned.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/05/my-ancient-city-ruby-pre-experience/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-05T09:23:52-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/05/my-ancient-city-ruby-pre-experience</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was the conclusion of Ancient City Ruby 2014.  But I&rsquo;d like to take us back in time a few days and review how my experience went.  For me, the journey began on the early morning of Tuesday, April 1st.  What I am about to say is not an Aprils Fool joke, though I did get fooled Tuesday morning by Sphero and the selfieBot.</p>

<p>Every Tuesday, Hashrocket hosts an event called &ldquo;Code &amp; Coffee.&rdquo;  On a normal day of C&amp;C I will see some of the regulars &ndash; Micah, Johnny, DL, Eugene and Stuart. (Hope I spelled those names correctly!)  And sometimes there will be a new person &ndash; I was the new person a few months back.  But when I saw this guy walk in, he had a look of familiarity.  In my mind I knew the face, but not the name.  He walked over to the table where several of us had our laptops open, and introducted himself as Justin Searls.  WAT?  No way, one of the panelist is at C&amp;C and he is talking to me?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go back in time a few days prior to the event. I was checking out Twitter and saw that one of the panelist, someone who I look up to in a huge way, was asking if anyone wanted to share a cab ride from JAX to the venue in St. Augustine.  So I took a chance and offered to transport this panelist, Katrina Owen, from the Airport to St. Augustine.  Honestly I wasn&rsquo;t sure if there would be a response.  My experience with Twitter, for the most part, is many people want a horde of followers, but they seldom respond when a follower, me for example, tweets them.</p>

<p>I should have remembered that this is the Ruby community and they are much more friendly and responsive.  Katrina accepted my offer and I was like a kid that just learned that his parents are taking him to Disney.  But wait, there is more!  Another of the panelist was looking for a ride so the offer was extended.  Surely I wouldn&rsquo;t be so lucky to have two gurus in my vehicle.  Offer Accepted!  The second panelist to brighten my day was Ben Lovell.</p>

<p>With what appeared to be luck on my side, I decided to go for a trifecta.  I sent an email to Aaron Patterson asking if he needed a ride.  How cool would that have been to have three gurus to hang with?  But the Ruby gods clearly thought I was pushing my luck.  I was priveledged enough to have two gurus to share some time with.</p>

<p>Fast forward a bit in time to Tuesday late afternoon.  I finished with some work for my day job and headed to the airport.  I was still in a state of slight disbelief.  Would these two panelist actually be at the airport and let me have the privelege of transporting them?  Ben&rsquo;s flight was a little delayed, but it actually worked out better for me.  I got the text message that they had their luggage and were ready for pickup at the B pickup area.  As I rolled up to the curb, my slight feelings of disbelief sub-sided and my internal flame of happiness was a well, &ldquo;flame on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a way, I wished that the drive time from JAX to the hotel(s) in St. Augustine was longer.  It was great to have Katrina and Ben all to myself.  Perhaps a bit selfish on my part, but I really did enjoy their company and having a casual conversation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to break up my experience into several parts, with this being the first.  I will next talk about how my experience went with the workshop I signed up for &ndash; Vim with Jon and Micah.  After that, I&rsquo;ll chat a bit about how the main days, Thursday and Friday, went at Ancient City Ruby 2014.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[My First Rake Task]]></title>
    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/29/my-first-rake-task/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-29T20:13:12-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/29/my-first-rake-task</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At my day job we primarly use Perl for both our scripting and tool type applications as well as using it with a splatter of PHP for some of our web page applications.  I&rsquo;m trying to get Ruby, and Rails, in the door and see if I can convert others over to Ruby.  I must confess, it is a steep upward battle.</p>

<p>However, I do have a web application on our development server and am preparing to deploy it to production.  It is a fairly simple web application that has three models and will enable us to manage the data elements of our Out-of-Band equipment and the connected devices.</p>

<p>When I first started the development, I manually created some test records.  Then I added a handful more via the seeds.rb file.  But when it came time to populating the database with real data, I needed a better solution.  I had compiled some data in Excel files with over 400 out-of-band devices and over 5,000 connected devices.  No way I was going to manually enter all of those.</p>

<p>This was earlier in the week, and luckily I was able to ask some of the gurus at our weekly Code &amp; Coffee how I could tackle this.  Micah suggested I use the CSV library in Ruby and see about populating the data that way.  He gave me a great nudge in the right direction.</p>

<p>I was fumbling around looking for answers when I saw some information about creating rake tasks.  So I studied up, and created the following rake file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>require 'csv'
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>oobs_file = "/path/to/file/oob_devices.CSV"
</span><span class='line'>devices_file = "/path/to/file/connected_devices.CSV"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>namespace :oob_import do
</span><span class='line'>  task :oobs =&gt; :environment do
</span><span class='line'>    Oob.delete_all
</span><span class='line'>    CSV.foreach(oobs_file, headers: true) do |row|
</span><span class='line'>      p row
</span><span class='line'>      Oob.create!(row.to_hash)
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  task :devices =&gt; :environment do
</span><span class='line'>    Device.delete_all
</span><span class='line'>    CSV.foreach(devices_file, headers: true) do |row|
</span><span class='line'>      oob = Oob.find_by_name("#{row[0]}")
</span><span class='line'>      oob.devices.create!(name: "#{row[1]}", pri_port: "#{row[2]}", active: "#{row[3]}", updated_by: "#{row[4]}")
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      p "Oob_ID: #{oob.id}, name: #{row[1]}, pri_port: #{row[2]}, active: #{row[3]}, updated_by: #{row[4]}"
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  task :all =&gt; [:oobs, :devices] do
</span><span class='line'>    puts "Refreshing Oob and Device Models"
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To import my data, I executed the rake task as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake oob_import:oobs
</span><span class='line'>rake oob_import:devices</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I could have used the taks, <em>oob_import:all</em> but I wanted to work in two steps so I could watch for errors and fix things while I was building this file.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t properly convey the joy and happiness I felt when I saw this new tool work!  It really made my day, especially as it took me a couple of hours of research, trial and error.  But this will make things really easy for me when I move the application to production.</p>

<p>Note that I have the code that starts with &ldquo;p&rdquo; in there so I have a nice visual of how the task is running.  If you don&rsquo;t need that visual confirmation, you could remove those two lines of code.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/29/week-2-and-a-half-at-bloc/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-29T10:02:23-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/29/week-2-and-a-half-at-bloc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first week of my training at Bloc went by very fast. For the most part it was a review of information/knowledge I had already gained, but was still worth it.  I had wanted to create another blog post earlier, but the completion of the second block took longer than I had anticipated.</p>

<p>So here we are, about about 2.5 weeks in. The second block, titled Rails Foundation, should take one about 40 hours.  At least that is the estimated time for completion.  If I wasn&rsquo;t working full-time, maybe I could have completed this block in one week.</p>

<p>The Rails Foundation block is composed of 20 checkpoints.  We learned a lot of concepts, and habits in those checkpoints.  There was some review for me, for example the lesson introduced the Devise gem.  I&rsquo;ve played with this a little bit so had some comfort with that checkpoint.  Though I did learn some new things related to Devise.</p>

<p>A totally new experience for me was when did the Authorization checkpoint, and was introduced to the Pundit gem.  I would say that Pundit is a little bit like CanCan.  I&rsquo;ve dabbled with CanCan a little bit, but I find Pundit to be pretty good.  I&rsquo;ll have a tough choice to make when it comes time for my Capstone project.  Should I go with Pundit, or revist CanCan (or CanCanCan.)</p>

<p>Another topic that I found useful, because it helped me with a task at my day job, was the lesson on Seeding.  While our main environment at work is Perl, I&rsquo;m slowing trying to sneak in some Ruby and Rails.  Leveraging some of the knowledge gained in the Seeding lesson, I was able to expand on that knowledge and compose my first rake task for populating my models with data in CSV files.  Ok, I&rsquo;m a bit off topic, steer back John!</p>

<p>There were two area where my progress slowed to a crawl in the second block.  The first was related to uploading images.  Recently Bloc added a Rails 4.x track and it looks like some of the lesson code examples are missing.  I wasn&rsquo;t able to see my Choose File option for uploading an image.  A trip to the Chat Room and a small wait for my turn, and my issue was solved by Xander.  Xander is great!  Everytime I&rsquo;ve had a question, he seems to be in the chat room and helps me out.</p>

<p>The second area I had trouble with was nesting.  I&rsquo;ll admit that I&rsquo;m still 100% solid with what I&rsquo;ve learned about nesting, but I&rsquo;m confident things will become clearer as I see and utilize more code.  During one of the lessons related to this nesting of Topics, Posts and Comments, I got stuck real bad.  I went to the chat room for help, but it was just at the time for that shift to end for the day.  Xander stayed for a few minutes and helped a lot.  But I was still stuck.</p>

<p>I was worried that all the changes I had made may have broken something.  So I fired off an email to my mentor to let him know I was stuck and to be prepared for a nice long chat the next day when we were scheduled to meet.  We meet the next day and he helped get me fixed in less than 5 minutes.  My eyes were so focused around the code and didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;see&rdquo; the code.  I had several silly mistakes.  For example I used the plural version instead of singular for a particular item/method.  Or I had a misplaced period.  And other issue, I had the order of a ) and a period mixed up.  Simple things for the trained eye.  It was great to have the mentor there to help me through what I thought was a major <em>fsk</em> up on my part.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I made some more punctuation type mistakes on the remaing checkpoints in this block.  But since I suffered so much earlier in the block, I was much more aware of what to look for.  The hard part for me now is when I see an error message, and know basically what is wrong, I don&rsquo;t yet have the experience to provide the solution.  But I&rsquo;m eagerly working at improving my problem solution skills.  :)</p>

<p>As I write this post, again about 2.5, well maybe 2.75 weeks in, I&rsquo;m now on the third Block &ndash; Features / Testing / Javascript.  This block is also estimated to take 40 hours.  There are 10 checkpoints and I&rsquo;ve completed the first 4 so far.  But now I&rsquo;m really entering an area of unfamiliarity.  Upcoming in this block is RSpec and Ajax.  Two areas that have close to zero amount of knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for my next update.  This coming week I will be going to Ancient City Ruby so I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll have the time to complete the third block.  But once I have completed it, I will post my thoughts here.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About two weeks ago I was trying to decide which on-line web developer education solution I would enroll in.  The decision was not easy.  Along with the weekly time requirements, roughly 25 hours per week, the financial cost is nothing to shrug off.  In the end I choose Bloc (<a href="http://www.bloc.io">http://www.bloc.io</a>)</p>

<p>My training at Bloc started this past Monday, March 10th.  The Bloc course runs about 12 weeks, broken down into four segments:</p>

<pre><code>1.  Environment Setup / Programming with Ruby
2.  Rails Foundation
3.  Features/Testing/Javascript
4.  Project Challenges
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just finished item 1 &ndash; Environment Setup / Programming with Ruby.  When I read the description of this section my first thought was, &ldquo;this should be easy.&rdquo;  I have been exploring Ruby and Rails for almost a year.  I&rsquo;ve installed RVM on several computers, worked with GitHub and Heroku, as well as several introductory tutorials.</p>

<p>And many of sub-sections in this first track were a nice and quick completion for me.  But, through each sub-section, I did learn something new.  For example, while working on setting up an app on Heroku, I learned how to add support for New Relic.  I&rsquo;ve seen ads and mention of New Relic a lot while learning Rails but never took a look at it.  Now I&rsquo;ve had a nice gentle introduction.</p>

<p>There are 20 sub-section to Environment Setup / Programming with Ruby.  I felt good and confident as I traversed through them one by one.  I was slowed down briefly in sub-section 14 &ndash; Arrays.  One of the exercises there introduced me to new code and techniques I had not yet experienced.  I love learning new stuff!</p>

<p>As I rounded out this section, I found myself staring at my nemesis &ndash; Blocks.  I don&rsquo;t know why, but I seem to have a mental <em>block</em> when it comes to Blocks (as well as Procs and Lambdas.)  This section took me a bit and I had to reach out for help.</p>

<p>In the Bloc program, each student has a mentor.  We have around 3 calls a week with our mentors.  When I got stuck it was after I had last talked with my mentor.  Not a problem &ndash; Bloc also has a staffed on-line chat room.  I popped in to the chat room and asked a question.  One of the staff there gave me a nudge.  After about 30 minutes I was still stuck.  I had gotten further, but still hadn&rsquo;t solved the problem.  Another question/discussion in the chat room and it became clear.  I was able to complete the lesson.  <strong>Happy Dance!</strong></p>

<p>I look forward to my next call with my mentor (tomorrow) and starting my next section &ndash; Rails Foundation.  As I progress through each section I&rsquo;ll return here to provide updates.</p>
