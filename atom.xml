    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most of my Rails projects, for personal use and education, have been using Postgresql or SQLite for the datbase backend.  At work our primary database is Oracle with a dash of MySQL.  Recently we decided to use MySQL with all future development, and migrate our tools/applications that use Oracle to use MySQL.</p>

<p>I downloaded and installed MySQL by grabbing the installer from the MySQL website:  <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/</a> and getting the version for my operating system &ndash; OS X Mavericks.</p>

<p>However, with this version installed I was having issues with bundler and getting the mysql gem to compile.  I tried a few solutions that I found on the internet, but none of them were working.</p>

<p>I found some other people who had issues, when using OSX Mavericks, with the MySQL installer.  They solved the issue by removing MySQL that was installed from the download via dev.mysql.com and then re-installing using Homebrew.</p>

<p>This solution worked for me as well.  I found this a bit odd, because earlier in the year I had issues with installing Postgres via Homebrew.  The solution for Postgres was to remove the Homebrew installation and use the installer from the Postgres site.</p>

    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/10/27/brew-a-fix-for-imagemagick-and-paperclip</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While working on a Rails project last week I encountered an issue where some of my tests were failing.  It had been a while since I worked on this project so I had to re-familiarize myself with what was going on.</p>

<p>The tests were failing when editing a profile and adding an image.  I popped over to the browser and performed a manual test to get a better idea of what was going on.  That is when I saw the following error: <em>&ldquo;Paperclip::Errors::NotIdentifiedByImageMagickError&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>To attempt to fix the issue, I first performed a simple uninstall and re-install of imagemagic using homebrew:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>brew uninstall imagemagick
</span><span class='line'>brew install imagemagick</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This didn&rsquo;t solve the problem.  Imagemagic has a command line utility, convert, which one can use to see if the application is working.  I tried a simple test:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>convert moonie.jpg moon.png</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But I continued to get errors even with that simple test.  So off to the internet for some deep research.  I came across the following steps, which solved the issue I was having.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>brew update
</span><span class='line'>brew doctor
</span><span class='line'>brew uninstall libtool
</span><span class='line'>brew uninstall imagemagic
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>cd /Library/Caches/Homebrew
</span><span class='line'>rm imagemag*
</span><span class='line'>rm libtool-2.4.2.tar.gz
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>brew doctor
</span><span class='line'>brew install libtool --universal
</span><span class='line'>brew link libool --force
</span><span class='line'>brew install imagemagic --build-from-source</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After completing the above steps, the command line tool, convert was successful.  I re-tested the Rails application, both manually, and via my test suite, and all was green again.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/testing-to-csv-method/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-23T09:32:37-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/testing-to-csv-method</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I covered a topic that resurfaced while I am in the process of upgrading one of our apps from Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.x. When I wrote that application I was a raw recruit &ndash; fresh to Ruby and Rails and just trying to get the idea to work.</p>

<p>But as I&rsquo;ve been improving my skills and expanding the ole grey matter, I wanted to write this new version, fully tested.  In the application there is a need to be able to export the data to a CSV formatted file.  I had the code from the old version of the app, and migrated it over.  However, I challenged myself to figure out how to write a test for the to_csv method in Baytech model.</p>

<p>Below is the code from the Baytech model:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def self.to_csv
</span><span class='line'>  CSV.generate(col_sep: ':') do |csv|
</span><span class='line'>    all.each do |baytech|
</span><span class='line'>      port = "X"
</span><span class='line'>      csv &lt;&lt; [baytech.name, baytech.phone_num, baytech.ip_addr, port, baytech.modem_type, port]
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I know the method works, as it has been working fine for 9 months or so now.  But I really wanted to figure out how to write a test for this method.  After much trial and error, along with research via books and google, I came up with the following solution:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>describe Baytech, '#to_csv' do
</span><span class='line'>  let(:baytech) { FactoryGirl.create(:baytech) }
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  before do
</span><span class='line'>    baytech
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  it { expect(Baytech.to_csv).to match /#{baytech.name}:#{baytech.phone_num}:#{baytech.ip_addr}:X:1:X/ }
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You may notice in the above code that I am referencing a Factory.  Here is a short version of that factory file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>FactoryGirl.define do
</span><span class='line'>  factory :baytech do
</span><span class='line'>    sequence(:name) {|n| "jaxfl0#{n}b9" }
</span><span class='line'>    sequence(:ip_addr) {|n| "10.1.2.#{n}" }
</span><span class='line'>    phone_num "7091234384"
</span><span class='line'>    region "USA"
</span><span class='line'>    modem_type "1"
</span><span class='line'>    ip_method "ssh"
</span><span class='line'>    active true
</span><span class='line'>    has_modem_line true
</span><span class='line'>    updated_by "cd1234"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    {-snip-}
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The keen eye may have caught something interesting in the to_csv method.  I&rsquo;m using an option, col_sep: &lsquo;:&rsquo; which allows me to use the : character as the delimiter instead of the default comma.</p>

<p>With the test in place, and passing, I felt better about the code in my to_csv method.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/09/16/reflect-on-inflectors/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-16T08:26:35-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/09/16/reflect-on-inflectors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I re-discovered an issue I ran into about 8 months ago.  I am re-writing an application I created for work.  The first version was written in Ruby 1.9.x and Rails 3.x.  I built the app using sticks and glue &ndash; no testing.</p>

<p>We are migrating to Ruby 2.1.x and Rails 4.1.x and rather than copy over the app and tweak it, I wanted to take a better approach, a TDD approach.</p>

<p>It is a pretty simple application, with two main models &ndash; Baytech and Device.  A Baytech can have zero to many devices, and a device should only belong to one baytech.</p>

<p>To frameout my two models I used the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rails g model baytech
</span><span class='line'>rails g model device</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Everything seemed fine at first.  Until I started writing tests and code then I re-discovered a blast from the past.  What I didn&rsquo;t catch was that Rails, with its vast knowledge, pluralized both baytech and device as:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>bayteches</li>
<li>devices</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, all is cool with the plural version of device as devices.  But the plural of baytech is baytechs.  Oh crap, what do I do?</p>

<p>The first time this happened to me, it took me a while to figure out what the heck was going on.  Eventually all roads led me to the file config/initializers/inflections.rb</p>

<p>Taking a look inside this file, I found the following, or something similar:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
</span><span class='line'># are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
</span><span class='line'># locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
</span><span class='line'># ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, '\1en'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, '\1'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.irregular 'person', 'people'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.uncountable %w( fish sheep )
</span><span class='line'># end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
</span><span class='line'># ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.acronym 'RESTful'
</span><span class='line'># end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To cure my issue, I had to make one small change to this file, making use of inflect.irregular:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>  inflect.irregular 'baytech', 'baytechs'
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once that change was made, anytime there was a need for the plural version of baytech, Rails knew to use baytechs.  Yeah!</p>

    <updated>2014-08-19T08:30:25-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/08/19/oracle-instant-client-osx</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently had the joy of installing Oracle 11g Express Edition on my home server.  That server runs CentOS 6.x as that is the flavor of Linux we use at my day job.  The server install is another story I will cover in the future, but today I would like to share how I got my laptop and development environment setup to connect to the Oracle Database.</p>

<p>Why in the world would I want to use Oracle you ask?  Well I don&rsquo;t really want to.  However, at the day job, that is what we use. And I wanted a more flexible development environment.  Due to limited resources, our &lsquo;dev&rsquo; database is also our disaster recovery database.  &lsquo;Nuff said?</p>

<p>In order to get my ruby environment setup to work with this monster database, I need two gems:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter', '~&gt; 1.5.0'
</span><span class='line'>gem 'ruby-oci8', '~&gt; 2.1.0'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a href="https://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced">Oracle Enhanced</a></p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself.  Lets take two steps back.</p>

<h2>Download some files</h2>

<p>On my server I have installed Oracle 11g Express, and my laptop is fairly current and run OS X Mavericks &ndash; a 64bit Operating System.  So let&rsquo;s get the appropriate client.</p>

<p>Download the required files from the Oracle Download site:
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/intel-macsoft-096467.html">Oracle Client</a></p>

<p>Note:  The following was learned by reviewing the blog over at: <a href="http://blog.codiez.co.za/2013/09/setup-oracle-instant-client-ruby-oci8-gem-mac/">codiez</a></p>

<p>For me, I downloaded these files:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>instantclient-sqlplus-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>instantclient-sdk-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Change to the directory where you downloaded the files
(e.g. cd Downloads &ndash; assuming you are in your home directory)</p>

<p>Unzip the three files:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-sqlplus-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-sdk-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Change directories to the new one created by the unzipping:
cd instantclient_11_2</p>

<p>Perform the following steps:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>mv * /usr/local/oracle/product/instantclient_64/11.2.0.4.0/bin/</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, we need to create and modify the tnsnames.org file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir -p /usr/local/oracle/admin/network

</span><span class='line'>  )</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we need to get our environment setup. Create a .oracle_client file in your home directory:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>I use the bash shell at work, but have been working with zsh at home lately.  So below I show how to add the above oracle environment variables to both bash and zsh:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>echo "source ~/.oracle_client" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</span><span class='line'>source ~/.bash_profile
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>echo "source ~/.oracle_client" &gt;&gt; ~/.zprofile
</span><span class='line'>source ~/.zprofile</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Optional step &ndash; if needed, you may need to update your /etc/hosts file so that you can resolve the IP address of your server to a fully qualified domain name.  See the following example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>192.168.1.14    rubyrailssvr.homenet.com</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We are almost there &ndash; go take a break if you need to.  Before we update our Gemfile to add the two gems I listed earlier, let&rsquo;s first test and make sure we can connect.  We will use sqlplus to perform that test, which is a tool that was installed as part of the instant client.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>You should be able to connect now, though I have made a huge assumption.  I have assumed that your Oracle DB is currently configured to accept remote connections.</p>

<p>Well that wraps up todays episode.  Get out there and &hellip;</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/07/24/wrap-up-bloc/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-24T12:05:14-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/07/24/wrap-up-bloc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been bad.  I let myself get consumed by my attendance of the on-line course at Bloc, and spending a lot of after-work-hours working on my personal project.  I have neglected my writing, and I apologize for my absence.</p>

<p>Earlier today I received notification from Disquis that someone, Nalani, had submitted a comment.  I am grateful for that comment as it reminded me of absence from this blog.  So with that nice kick-in-the-pants, let&rsquo;s move forward.</p>

<p>I completed my on-line training of the Bloc.io course on June 9th 2014.  Overall I was satisfied with the training and can confidently recommend it to others, depending on their situation.  What?</p>

<p>Bloc is not for everyone.  The first barrier to overcome is the cost.  I believe I got in before the price increase so the tuition was around $4250 if memory serves me correctly.  I believe the price to be fair for what you get.  However, I would not suggest that anyone plop down that money if they are currently struggling financially.</p>

<p>Depending on your employment needs, Bloc may not be for you.  For me, I took the course to better my programming skills and to assist me move forward with my personal project.  But I would not say that what I learned would allow me to get a job similar to what I have now, at my current pay rate.  I think the education would help one land a junior-developer job or an internship at a dev shop.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert, but from my experience with local dev shops here, there is a heavy emphasis on testing and Test-Drive-Development(TDD.)  And when I took the Bloc course, that area was lacking.  You can see my previous post for more information.</p>

<p>Yesterday I received an email from Bloc that indicated that they improving the Full Stack program by adding more testing to the course.  Not sure if it was my feedback, or feedback from many of us past students, but I&rsquo;m glad to see that they continuously improve on their product.</p>

<p>Is Bloc for you?  Maybe.  If you are like me, someone who has a day job and wanted to improve their programming skills, while trying to bring your product idea to life, then yes.  Maybe you are someone with a great idea, a founder, and want to get a better grip on what it will take to produce your product.  I think Bloc can help you there.  If you are trying to break ground in the industry and land your first job or internship, then yes, I think Bloc is for you.  If you need the extra hand holding while learning the basics, then yes I think you will get value from the Bloc program.</p>

<p>I do want to end with a note about the mentorship, and you may have read into my words at the end of the last paragraph.  If you are seeking what I consider advance knowledge and/or assistance, you may be dissapointed.  While I found the mentorship to be very helpful at the beginning and middle of my training, I was dissapointed at the end when it came to my capstone project.  Fortunately for me, about 8 weeks in to my Bloc training, I met a guy, Shaun, who became my &lsquo;external-mentor.&rsquo;  If not for him, I would not have been able to complete some of the Bloc assignments the way I wanted &ndash; via TDD.  Sure I could have completed them, but I want to develop by writing tests first.  Shaun has also helped me with my personal project and taken it so much farther than I could have done on my own.  What I&rsquo;m trying to end with is this &ndash; no matter if you take the training at Bloc or else where, find a mentor who will spend the time with you to help you learn.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/05/11/enter-the-4th-block/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-11T18:05:24-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/05/11/enter-the-4th-block</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Picking up from where I left off with my block experience (see previous post, Week 2 and a half at Bloc,) a lot of good things, and some bad things, have occurred.  I had finished, what was called at the time, the third block, which included lessons on RSpec, Testing Users and both creating and destroying using Ajax.</p>

<p>The end of Block Three took me a bit longer to complete compared to how I progressed through the first two blocks.  The material in the third block was new to me.  It was during the end of this block, and creeping into the beginning of block four that I began to have issues with my mentor.  In the first two blocks, since I didn&rsquo;t need much help, I didn&rsquo;t mind that our sessions tended to be brief.  Usually they ran up to 10 minutes.  But our sessions are booked for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>My mentor during this time had missed a some meetings and had asked me to reschedule a few times.  I&rsquo;m flexible so I didn&rsquo;t see an issue.  But there was one time that I needed to reschedule and the mentor wouldn&rsquo;t work with me to make up the time.  Time much needed as I was having trouble with the project I had selected in Block Four &ndash; Saas Wiki Collaboration Tool.  I was getting very frustrated.</p>

<p>I reached out to student coordinator at Bloc, Karen, and discussed the issues I was having.  I explained that in the beggining I had gotten ahead, but now with all the problems I was encountering with this mentor, I was getting behind.  And I felt it very disrepectful that I was asked on several occasions to modify my schedule for him, but the one time I needed a re-schedule, he didn&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>Karen helped me out and let me pick out a new mentor.  She said that they would add a week to my enrollment to help make up for some of the lost time.  (Think I need to check on that because it doesn&rsquo;t look like they added a week.)  The new mentor, Charlie, was a huge improvment.  Never did I feel like he was trying to get me off the phone.  In fact, on several calls we went over the scheduled 30 minutes.</p>

<p>While working with the new mentor, Charlie, has been a much better experience, I feel that there is something missing from the program.  Although it is said that students will do pair programming and testing, I don&rsquo;t find either to come near what I was expecting.  It may be that my expectations are set to high from what the folks at Bloc had planned to offer.  I can understand that they have a range of differently skilled students.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m far off in saying that most newbies to this program probably don&rsquo;t care as much about testing as I do.</p>

<p>I find this mediocre approach to testing to transcend into the help one would get in the Office Hours Chat room.  I&rsquo;ll provide a brief example.  I was stuck on how to write a test that would make sure that any user, other than a logged in user, would not be able to access the ability to upgrade a users account by direct url navigation.  When I posed my question the answer I got was that I should use Pundit&rsquo;s policies and don&rsquo;t display the upgrade button unless the user is logged in and allowed to upgrade.</p>

<p>I had explained that I had already written tests for that, and the code to make the tests green, but I wanted to ensure that a malicous user would not be able to access the url for an upgrade directly.  The short answer I got was &ldquo;&hellip;well the users shouldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;  Yeah, well credit card thieves should not steal peoples credit card info and identies either, but I&rsquo;m sure the credit card companies do whatever they can to protect against those thieves.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t think the program was meant to take testing as seriously as I am.  It seems the program gives one just enough to say, &ldquo;&hellip; yeah I know how to test with RSpec.&rdquo;  Although I&rsquo;m happy with my mentor Charlie, I felt a bit frustrated on our calls when trying to work through testing issues.  So frustrated in fact that I stopped testing the proper way and just worked on trying to complete the assignment.</p>

<p>Bloc changed the student dashboard and I got really worried.  I was reviewing where I was in the program and the dashboard was telling me that I was behind.  The dashboard lists 5 projects, including the one I was working on, Saas Wiki Collaboration.  The sixth project is for our capstone.  Seeing that I had only four weeks left, and still hadn&rsquo;t finished this Wiki project, I got a bit frazzled.  It is not like I haven&rsquo;t been putting in the time!</p>

<p>On my mentoring call with Charlie last Friday I asked what the deal was.  There was no way I could finish all those projects and have time for my capstone.  My previous mentor had said that I only needed to pick one if I wanted to spend more time on the capstone project.  Luckily, Charlie confirmed that the dashboard was a bit confusing.  Students have the option to do more than one project before their capstone, but it is not required.</p>

<p>That made me feel a bit better, but I still needed to wrap up this Wiki project.  The main reason I took this course was to work on my capstone and have help when/where I needed via the mentorship and Office Hours Chat room.  Please don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I have learned a lot via the program, but my main goal is to work on my personal project.</p>

<p>With some &lsquo;external&rsquo; help, I was able to wrap up this Wiki project.  At least I believe it to be done according to the original requirements.  I even was able to get the Stripe intergration to work, with tests!  I&rsquo;ll have another blog post regarding the external help &ndash; stay tuned!</p>

<p>I have another mentoring call on Monday &ndash; 05/12/14.  We should be able to discuss my capstone project and get an idea of how to get started.  The nice thing about the Saas Wiki project is that there are a lot of components of that app which will apply to my capstone project.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more information regarding my experience at <a href="http://www.bloc.io">Bloc.io</a>  I will be publishing an overview of the program at the conclusion of enrollment.</p>

    <updated>2014-04-17T22:10:08-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/17/3-noobs-at-lillys</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This evening I attended the RubyJax OpenHacks event at Lilly&rsquo;s Cafe out at the beach.  I believe the normal schedule has the OpenHacks event on the third Thursday of each month.  I like to get to th event a bit early as parking in that area can be a royal pain.</p>

<p>Shortly after I settled in, another new guy to the group, Jesse, joined me.  I had met Jesse a previous week at one of the Code &amp; Coffee events.  We got to talk a little bit about ourselves and what we were trying to accomplish in our quest of learning.</p>

<p>Enter the third n00b, Josh.  I was starting wonder if Micah has set the three of us in a fun game of snipe hunting.  Get all the new people together and laugh at them from a distance.  :)  The three of chatter a bit back and forth for a while, sharing some of our experiences.</p>

<p>One can learn from others that are new to Ruby, or anything for that matter.  For example, Jesse shared a neat tool he was using with me called Dash (<a href="http://kapeli.com/dash">http://kapeli.com/dash</a>).  This is a neat little app that sources the documentation of too many to count languages and frameworks.  I downloaded the app while he was demonstrating, and was excited to see all of the reference material available for the subjects I was interested in.  And then some!</p>

<p>I shared my current experience with Bloc.io and demonstrated their website, including a sample of some of the lessons I had completed and the one I had just started &ndash; my big project.  About this time Michah had showed up and I know that at least I felt at ease.  Micah had helped me before with some learning and I was hoping to pick his brain again.</p>

<p>Before we get to that though, Josh took a turn at sharing some resources.  The one that really stuck out to me was this website:  <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/">http://gitimmersion.com/</a>  I found this site to be a great resource, for the beginner, in learning how to use git.  So far I&rsquo;ve made it up to lab 14.  What I find really useful about this site is that I will be able to use the lessons on the site to help educate my fellow team workers at my day job.  Trying hard to get us all to use version control.</p>

<p>Just at I was getting ready to ask Micah a question, we had another join our group.  I was surprised, but very please to see Paolo Perrota join our group.  I think it is safe to say that all of use new guys were very happy to be hanging with two Ruby Gurus.</p>

<p>Rounding out the evening I reached out for some help with a coding issue I was having.  For the OOB Web app that I&rsquo;ve been developing for the day job, I need to support an older app.  This app uses the same data that I&rsquo;m migrating to the web app.  But the data in the files that support the app need to be delimited with a : and contain fields that we no longer need.  I had been able to figure out how to build that information as a : delimited export via the browser, but what I really needed was a rake task that could build two text files.</p>

<p>Working with Micah, he showed me where I was doing things correctly, and where I was making some mis-steps.  Using his guidance I was able to finish writing my second rake job &ndash; exporting the data.  I don&rsquo;t recall if I have mentioned it before, but Micah also helped me construct my first rake job &ndash; importing the data.</p>

<p>The time at Lilly&rsquo;s flew by, but I&rsquo;m confident in saying that all of us newbies learned something useful.  Looking forward to the next Code &amp; Coffee and OpenHacks events.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/07/ancient-city-ruby-2014-day-two/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-07T18:35:20-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/07/ancient-city-ruby-2014-day-two</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Day two was a rough start for me.  I over slept a little bit so I didn&rsquo;t have time to get breakfast at home.  Luckily, there was some breakfast provided at the conference.  I&rsquo;m not a big carb eater, but I knew that if I didn&rsquo;t eat something, it would be a rough day.  So down went a half bagel, some fruit, a glass of water and a coffee chaser.</p>

<p>Starting out the day was someone I had heard of, but never met &ndash; Terence Lee.  Terence works at Heroku as well as participates on the Ruby core team as a contributor.  I enjoyed this talk because I&rsquo;ve been using Heroku in my knowledge quest and found the topic to be relevant.  I think we sometimes take for granted what is going on behind the scenes, by guys like Terence, to ensure easy deployment of our apps.  In summary &ndash; make sure you are off of Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2.</p>

<p>For day two, I took the most notes during the second talk by Craig Kerstiens.  He talked about Postgres which is the primary database that I&rsquo;ve been using in my Rails applications.  Craig confirmed something that I had encountered two days earlier &ndash; don&rsquo;t use homebrew for Postgres.  Download and use the Postgres.app from their website.  I had a lot of issues during my workshop due to homebrew and its installation of Postgres.  Along with good tips for Postgres related resources, I also learned new stuff like sequential scan vs index scan.  And using Gin for indexing when you have multiple values in a column vs the standard BTree index method.  Rounding out his talk, I walked away with a to-do list of required research on HStore and jsonb.</p>

<p>Lunch on day two was the only part of the conference I didn&rsquo;t like.  I am not a pasta fan at all and sadly didn&rsquo;t find much I could eat.  I ended up snacking on two pieces of cheese and a chunk of bread.  Where the meal failed for me, the desert was a home run!  So I filled up on desert and coffee.  Yup, I was a bit jittery for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>After lunch it was time for Aaron.  His presentation had both a healthy serving of comedic relief as well as filling geekery.  Who else but Aaron would code a way, using a webcam, to scan all of his Magic the Gathering cards and catalog their value?  Oh and did I mention there were cats?  Aaron urged the audience to help him test out one of his projects related to OpenCV.  We were to all send him a tweet with the words &ldquo;Photo Me&rdquo;.  The goal was for his program to see the tweet, take a picture of Aaron at that moment in time, and send the picture to the person who tweeted him.  Well it seems one variable wasn&rsquo;t accounted for &ndash; Twitter.  With a flood of incoming requests to his Twitter account, the &ldquo;enforcers&rdquo; locked his account.</p>

<p>Something that I had forgotten to mention earlier was that for most of the conference, Ben sat with me.  I really thought this was cool.  Most of the speakers sat together up front or to the side.  But I got to sit with Ben &ndash; just me and him.</p>

<p>Which brings me to one of Ben&rsquo;s friends &ndash; Konstantin.  Ben had made some reference to Konstantin in his presentation &ndash; well more like to Konstantin&rsquo;s bag which apparently got lost while enroute to a conference in the Philippines.  Konstantin had a good bit of humor in his presentation which focused on security.  It was very englightening to learn about the many different ways hackers try to compromise web applications, including Rails applications.  Both the Ruby and Rails teams make a great effort to eliminate/prevent security issues.  I&rsquo;ll admit there were parts of the talk that went over my head.  But overall, I found it very usefull and an area where I want to learn more.</p>

<p>Near the end of Konstantin&rsquo;s talk I started to feel the effect of not eating a proper lunch, and an overload of sweets.  I started getting a little light-headed.  So the end of the conference was a bit of a blur.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been to two Ruby related conferences &ndash; Ruby Conf 2013 in Miami, and now this one, Ancient City Ruby Conf 2014.  Although the one if Miami was much larger, I enjoyed the Ancient City one more.  I felt like I learned more at ACR and fit in better.  At the conference in Miami I very much felt like an outsider.  But at ACR I met a lot of people from all over the US and the world.  I am looking forward to another Ancient City Ruby conference in 2015!</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/06/ancient-city-ruby-2014-day-one/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-06T20:55:09-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/06/ancient-city-ruby-2014-day-one</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The actual conference was split across two days, and followed the single-track format.  This was unlike my experience at Ruby Conf 2013 &ndash; Miami, which was multiple topics going on concurrently.  For the first day, the following speakers were lined up:  Leon Gersing, Justin Searls, David Copeland, Katrina Owen, Richard Schneeman, and Ben Lovell.  Of all those speakers, I only had ever heard of three, and as it so happened, met each one of them: Justin Searls, Katrina Owen and Ben Lovell.</p>

<p>In a quick summary of the day, I wrote the most notes from the talk by Leon, learned the most from Katrina&rsquo;s talk and laughed my ass off, and learned some stuff, from Ben&rsquo;s talk.  Justin talk also had my interest and I had jotted down some notes from his presentation.</p>

<p>I really liked Leon&rsquo;s talk as to me it was not directly programming/developer related, but more so a spiritual and inspirational discussion.  I don&rsquo;t know if it was planned this way, but I believe it was perfectly executed as the first talk of the day &ndash; really set a good mood and environment.  Something that Leon said really moved me.  He said: &ldquo;Twitter, Facebook, Instagram are all simulations of relationships.&rdquo;  I thought that was very powerful.</p>

<p>Before I continue, I just want to say that I enjoyed all of the talks from the speakers on this day.  But given my current skill level with Ruby and as a programmer, some of the talks were more moving and relevant to me.  I&rsquo;m sure others had similar, but different results.</p>

<p>Three speakers in, some brief talks by some sponsors as well as lightening talks, and it was time for lunch.  I really enjoyed the lunch that was provided at the hotel for the conference.  Not only was the meal yummy, but the deserts were great as well.</p>

<p>On a nice full stomach, with a big smile on my face, it was time for Katrina&rsquo;s talk.  I really enjoy her presentation style and I feel that the delivery was at a level that I was able to absorb.  Katrina took us through a refactoring session for &ldquo;Bob.&rdquo;  Frightenly, some of that code looked familiar :)  If you get a chance, you can check out her prentation at: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kytrinyx/overkill">Overkill</a></p>

<p>Being the last speaker on a given day is a tough task.  People tend to start getting tired.  Leave it to Ben to fire up the crowd.  He had all of us rolling with laughter from his opening remarks to his closing arguments.  And along the way we learned a bit about testing APIs.  Watch out for those &ldquo;f#$@ing sharks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Day one didn&rsquo;t actually end after Ben&rsquo;s talk.  That evening some of the conference attendees went on the Ghost Ride, while the rest of us got to do the Pirate Ship adventure.  Even though I live in Jacksonville, which isn&rsquo;t too far from St. Augustine, I had not ever been on the Pirate Ship.  It was a lot of fun.  I just wish that I had my heavier hoodie and it got a bit cold on the water.  On the ship I got to meet a few other people from Hash Rocket, including Paul Elliott.  I had heard Paul&rsquo;s voice on several episodes of the Ruby5 podcast, and it was nice to meet him in person.</p>

<p>All-in-all, day one was a big hit for me.  Oh, I almost forgot!  At the beginning of the day, before the first talk started, I got to meet and shake hands with Aaron Patterson.  Yeah, you could say I&rsquo;m a fanboi of his.</p>

    <updated>2014-04-05T10:38:58-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/05/ancient-city-ruby-workshop</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my last post I discussed events prior to Ancient City Ruby 2014.  Now it is time to discuss my experience at the actual workshop and conference.  The conference part was spread across two days, Thursday and Friday, and there was an optional workshop day &ndash; Wednesday.  There were three different workshops offered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refactoring Rails by Katrina Owen</li>
<li>Rock@Vim by Jon Allured and Micah</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails: First Expedition by Beverly Nelson</li>
</ul>


<p>I had a tough decision to make.  I really wanted to attend Katrina&rsquo;s workshop, but I don&rsquo;t believe my skill set is good enough at this time to have been able to participate.  I thought that I&rsquo;d surely slow the class down.  On the other hand, I think I&rsquo;m beyond the Ruby on Rails: First Expedition level.  I am horrible at Vim, so it seemed obvious that I should sign up for the Rock@Vim workshop, and I did.</p>

<p>The Vim workshop was taught by two Hashrocket employees, Jon and Micah.  I&rsquo;d never met Jon before as he works out of the Chicago office.  But I have met Micah before, and he has helped me out a few times when I have gotten stuck or had questions.  Having some familiarity with a teacher was a plus.</p>

<p>I really wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect for the workshop, or how we would approach the topic.  I just want to get better at Vim.  Primarily, being better at vim would help at my day job as we ssh to most of our devices.  But I also want to try pair programming and from what I&rsquo;ve researched, one really needs to know vim.</p>

<p>The workshop started off good.  Jon and Micah introduced us to dotmatrix:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git clone https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix.git</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I don&rsquo;t know all the ins and outs but I guess I would summarize it as saying that by using dotmatrix I was able to configure my environment to by more &ldquo;HashRocketey&rdquo;  From the README.md file:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dotmatrix is a collection of dotfiles used at Hashrocket to customize various development tools. This project is the culmination of many years worth of tinkering with our favorite tools to get them to behave just right. We think using dotmatrix makes working with these tools more pleasant and hope you will too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were a few steps involved to get everything up and running, but I won&rsquo;t bore you with those details.  After the class was all setup, or at least we thought we were setup, we moved on to cloning a practice Rails project which we were going to use in our lessons for vim.</p>

<p>During part of the lesson I experienced an issue.  For some reason I was getting hung up with some issues involving Postgres.  I started to fall behind the class as I was trouble shooting.  Finally I just asked &ndash; &ldquo;&hellip; can I switch this project to SQLite to get beyond these problems?&rdquo;  Jon agreed that would be a good idea.  So I switched and tried to catch up.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t going well for me.  Working with my Postgres issue caused me to miss some key instructions and details that the rest of the class had observed.  Instead of fighting to try to figure things out, I just sat back and tried to focus.  I guess Micah saw that I was having some trouble so he came over to assist.  When I explained my situation he helped to get me back on track and also has Jon show me some stuff that helped to get me caught up.</p>

<p>At about the time I got caught up, we were quickly coming upon lunch time.  There was only four of us students plus Jon and Micah.  So we all went out to lunch together at A1A Ale Works.  It was a good time.  The advantage of a small class enabled us to be able to get to know each other and see what each others experience was like.</p>

<p>After lunch we were back at the brain fillage.  I was starting to get a bit tired, and it seemed like the topics were getting harder.  But we pressed on and learned some more neat things with using vim.  I learned enough during the workshop to make me want to learn more.  I will continue my vim learning, using what I absorbed in the workshop as a foundation, and utilize other resources like Vim Genius (<a href="http://vimgenius.com/">http://vimgenius.com/</a>) and the cool screencast series Vimcasts (<a href="http://vimcasts.org/">http://vimcasts.org/</a>).  Also, I picked up a copy of &ldquo;Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought,&rdquo; by Drew Neil who also produces the vimcasts.</p>

<p>Although I had some tough, frustrating moments, overall I enjoyed the Vim workshop.  Whether Jon knew it or not, he gave me a homework assignment.  As I was practicing at home that evening, I noticed that my prompt in the terminal was really long.  I prefer the following format:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>jfhogarty@Serenity:(source+*-)$</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So I had to figure out how to fix my prompt.  It wasn&rsquo;t too hard, just an edit to my ~/.bashrc file.  In my next post I will review my experience of the first day of the conference.  Stay tuned.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/05/my-ancient-city-ruby-pre-experience/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-05T09:23:52-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/05/my-ancient-city-ruby-pre-experience</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was the conclusion of Ancient City Ruby 2014.  But I&rsquo;d like to take us back in time a few days and review how my experience went.  For me, the journey began on the early morning of Tuesday, April 1st.  What I am about to say is not an Aprils Fool joke, though I did get fooled Tuesday morning by Sphero and the selfieBot.</p>

<p>Every Tuesday, Hashrocket hosts an event called &ldquo;Code &amp; Coffee.&rdquo;  On a normal day of C&amp;C I will see some of the regulars &ndash; Micah, Johnny, DL, Eugene and Stuart. (Hope I spelled those names correctly!)  And sometimes there will be a new person &ndash; I was the new person a few months back.  But when I saw this guy walk in, he had a look of familiarity.  In my mind I knew the face, but not the name.  He walked over to the table where several of us had our laptops open, and introducted himself as Justin Searls.  WAT?  No way, one of the panelist is at C&amp;C and he is talking to me?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go back in time a few days prior to the event. I was checking out Twitter and saw that one of the panelist, someone who I look up to in a huge way, was asking if anyone wanted to share a cab ride from JAX to the venue in St. Augustine.  So I took a chance and offered to transport this panelist, Katrina Owen, from the Airport to St. Augustine.  Honestly I wasn&rsquo;t sure if there would be a response.  My experience with Twitter, for the most part, is many people want a horde of followers, but they seldom respond when a follower, me for example, tweets them.</p>

<p>I should have remembered that this is the Ruby community and they are much more friendly and responsive.  Katrina accepted my offer and I was like a kid that just learned that his parents are taking him to Disney.  But wait, there is more!  Another of the panelist was looking for a ride so the offer was extended.  Surely I wouldn&rsquo;t be so lucky to have two gurus in my vehicle.  Offer Accepted!  The second panelist to brighten my day was Ben Lovell.</p>

<p>With what appeared to be luck on my side, I decided to go for a trifecta.  I sent an email to Aaron Patterson asking if he needed a ride.  How cool would that have been to have three gurus to hang with?  But the Ruby gods clearly thought I was pushing my luck.  I was priveledged enough to have two gurus to share some time with.</p>

<p>Fast forward a bit in time to Tuesday late afternoon.  I finished with some work for my day job and headed to the airport.  I was still in a state of slight disbelief.  Would these two panelist actually be at the airport and let me have the privelege of transporting them?  Ben&rsquo;s flight was a little delayed, but it actually worked out better for me.  I got the text message that they had their luggage and were ready for pickup at the B pickup area.  As I rolled up to the curb, my slight feelings of disbelief sub-sided and my internal flame of happiness was a well, &ldquo;flame on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a way, I wished that the drive time from JAX to the hotel(s) in St. Augustine was longer.  It was great to have Katrina and Ben all to myself.  Perhaps a bit selfish on my part, but I really did enjoy their company and having a casual conversation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to break up my experience into several parts, with this being the first.  I will next talk about how my experience went with the workshop I signed up for &ndash; Vim with Jon and Micah.  After that, I&rsquo;ll chat a bit about how the main days, Thursday and Friday, went at Ancient City Ruby 2014.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/29/my-first-rake-task/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-29T20:13:12-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/29/my-first-rake-task</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At my day job we primarly use Perl for both our scripting and tool type applications as well as using it with a splatter of PHP for some of our web page applications.  I&rsquo;m trying to get Ruby, and Rails, in the door and see if I can convert others over to Ruby.  I must confess, it is a steep upward battle.</p>

<p>However, I do have a web application on our development server and am preparing to deploy it to production.  It is a fairly simple web application that has three models and will enable us to manage the data elements of our Out-of-Band equipment and the connected devices.</p>

<p>When I first started the development, I manually created some test records.  Then I added a handful more via the seeds.rb file.  But when it came time to populating the database with real data, I needed a better solution.  I had compiled some data in Excel files with over 400 out-of-band devices and over 5,000 connected devices.  No way I was going to manually enter all of those.</p>

<p>This was earlier in the week, and luckily I was able to ask some of the gurus at our weekly Code &amp; Coffee how I could tackle this.  Micah suggested I use the CSV library in Ruby and see about populating the data that way.  He gave me a great nudge in the right direction.</p>

<p>I was fumbling around looking for answers when I saw some information about creating rake tasks.  So I studied up, and created the following rake file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>27</span>
<span class='line-number'>28</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>require 'csv'
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>oobs_file = "/path/to/file/oob_devices.CSV"
</span><span class='line'>devices_file = "/path/to/file/connected_devices.CSV"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>namespace :oob_import do
</span><span class='line'>  task :oobs =&gt; :environment do
</span><span class='line'>    Oob.delete_all
</span><span class='line'>    CSV.foreach(oobs_file, headers: true) do |row|
</span><span class='line'>      p row
</span><span class='line'>      Oob.create!(row.to_hash)
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  task :devices =&gt; :environment do
</span><span class='line'>    Device.delete_all
</span><span class='line'>    CSV.foreach(devices_file, headers: true) do |row|
</span><span class='line'>      oob = Oob.find_by_name("#{row[0]}")
</span><span class='line'>      oob.devices.create!(name: "#{row[1]}", pri_port: "#{row[2]}", active: "#{row[3]}", updated_by: "#{row[4]}")
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      p "Oob_ID: #{oob.id}, name: #{row[1]}, pri_port: #{row[2]}, active: #{row[3]}, updated_by: #{row[4]}"
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  task :all =&gt; [:oobs, :devices] do
</span><span class='line'>    puts "Refreshing Oob and Device Models"
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To import my data, I executed the rake task as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake oob_import:oobs
</span><span class='line'>rake oob_import:devices</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I could have used the taks, <em>oob_import:all</em> but I wanted to work in two steps so I could watch for errors and fix things while I was building this file.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t properly convey the joy and happiness I felt when I saw this new tool work!  It really made my day, especially as it took me a couple of hours of research, trial and error.  But this will make things really easy for me when I move the application to production.</p>

<p>Note that I have the code that starts with &ldquo;p&rdquo; in there so I have a nice visual of how the task is running.  If you don&rsquo;t need that visual confirmation, you could remove those two lines of code.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/29/week-2-and-a-half-at-bloc/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-29T10:02:23-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/29/week-2-and-a-half-at-bloc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first week of my training at Bloc went by very fast. For the most part it was a review of information/knowledge I had already gained, but was still worth it.  I had wanted to create another blog post earlier, but the completion of the second block took longer than I had anticipated.</p>

<p>So here we are, about about 2.5 weeks in. The second block, titled Rails Foundation, should take one about 40 hours.  At least that is the estimated time for completion.  If I wasn&rsquo;t working full-time, maybe I could have completed this block in one week.</p>

<p>The Rails Foundation block is composed of 20 checkpoints.  We learned a lot of concepts, and habits in those checkpoints.  There was some review for me, for example the lesson introduced the Devise gem.  I&rsquo;ve played with this a little bit so had some comfort with that checkpoint.  Though I did learn some new things related to Devise.</p>

<p>A totally new experience for me was when did the Authorization checkpoint, and was introduced to the Pundit gem.  I would say that Pundit is a little bit like CanCan.  I&rsquo;ve dabbled with CanCan a little bit, but I find Pundit to be pretty good.  I&rsquo;ll have a tough choice to make when it comes time for my Capstone project.  Should I go with Pundit, or revist CanCan (or CanCanCan.)</p>

<p>Another topic that I found useful, because it helped me with a task at my day job, was the lesson on Seeding.  While our main environment at work is Perl, I&rsquo;m slowing trying to sneak in some Ruby and Rails.  Leveraging some of the knowledge gained in the Seeding lesson, I was able to expand on that knowledge and compose my first rake task for populating my models with data in CSV files.  Ok, I&rsquo;m a bit off topic, steer back John!</p>

<p>There were two area where my progress slowed to a crawl in the second block.  The first was related to uploading images.  Recently Bloc added a Rails 4.x track and it looks like some of the lesson code examples are missing.  I wasn&rsquo;t able to see my Choose File option for uploading an image.  A trip to the Chat Room and a small wait for my turn, and my issue was solved by Xander.  Xander is great!  Everytime I&rsquo;ve had a question, he seems to be in the chat room and helps me out.</p>

<p>The second area I had trouble with was nesting.  I&rsquo;ll admit that I&rsquo;m still 100% solid with what I&rsquo;ve learned about nesting, but I&rsquo;m confident things will become clearer as I see and utilize more code.  During one of the lessons related to this nesting of Topics, Posts and Comments, I got stuck real bad.  I went to the chat room for help, but it was just at the time for that shift to end for the day.  Xander stayed for a few minutes and helped a lot.  But I was still stuck.</p>

<p>I was worried that all the changes I had made may have broken something.  So I fired off an email to my mentor to let him know I was stuck and to be prepared for a nice long chat the next day when we were scheduled to meet.  We meet the next day and he helped get me fixed in less than 5 minutes.  My eyes were so focused around the code and didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;see&rdquo; the code.  I had several silly mistakes.  For example I used the plural version instead of singular for a particular item/method.  Or I had a misplaced period.  And other issue, I had the order of a ) and a period mixed up.  Simple things for the trained eye.  It was great to have the mentor there to help me through what I thought was a major <em>fsk</em> up on my part.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I made some more punctuation type mistakes on the remaing checkpoints in this block.  But since I suffered so much earlier in the block, I was much more aware of what to look for.  The hard part for me now is when I see an error message, and know basically what is wrong, I don&rsquo;t yet have the experience to provide the solution.  But I&rsquo;m eagerly working at improving my problem solution skills.  :)</p>

<p>As I write this post, again about 2.5, well maybe 2.75 weeks in, I&rsquo;m now on the third Block &ndash; Features / Testing / Javascript.  This block is also estimated to take 40 hours.  There are 10 checkpoints and I&rsquo;ve completed the first 4 so far.  But now I&rsquo;m really entering an area of unfamiliarity.  Upcoming in this block is RSpec and Ajax.  Two areas that have close to zero amount of knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for my next update.  This coming week I will be going to Ancient City Ruby so I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll have the time to complete the third block.  But once I have completed it, I will post my thoughts here.</p>

    <updated>2014-03-15T19:46:34-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/15/first-week-at-bloc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About two weeks ago I was trying to decide which on-line web developer education solution I would enroll in.  The decision was not easy.  Along with the weekly time requirements, roughly 25 hours per week, the financial cost is nothing to shrug off.  In the end I choose Bloc (<a href="http://www.bloc.io">http://www.bloc.io</a>)</p>

<p>My training at Bloc started this past Monday, March 10th.  The Bloc course runs about 12 weeks, broken down into four segments:</p>

<pre><code>1.  Environment Setup / Programming with Ruby
2.  Rails Foundation
3.  Features/Testing/Javascript
4.  Project Challenges
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just finished item 1 &ndash; Environment Setup / Programming with Ruby.  When I read the description of this section my first thought was, &ldquo;this should be easy.&rdquo;  I have been exploring Ruby and Rails for almost a year.  I&rsquo;ve installed RVM on several computers, worked with GitHub and Heroku, as well as several introductory tutorials.</p>

<p>And many of sub-sections in this first track were a nice and quick completion for me.  But, through each sub-section, I did learn something new.  For example, while working on setting up an app on Heroku, I learned how to add support for New Relic.  I&rsquo;ve seen ads and mention of New Relic a lot while learning Rails but never took a look at it.  Now I&rsquo;ve had a nice gentle introduction.</p>

<p>There are 20 sub-section to Environment Setup / Programming with Ruby.  I felt good and confident as I traversed through them one by one.  I was slowed down briefly in sub-section 14 &ndash; Arrays.  One of the exercises there introduced me to new code and techniques I had not yet experienced.  I love learning new stuff!</p>

<p>As I rounded out this section, I found myself staring at my nemesis &ndash; Blocks.  I don&rsquo;t know why, but I seem to have a mental <em>block</em> when it comes to Blocks (as well as Procs and Lambdas.)  This section took me a bit and I had to reach out for help.</p>

<p>In the Bloc program, each student has a mentor.  We have around 3 calls a week with our mentors.  When I got stuck it was after I had last talked with my mentor.  Not a problem &ndash; Bloc also has a staffed on-line chat room.  I popped in to the chat room and asked a question.  One of the staff there gave me a nudge.  After about 30 minutes I was still stuck.  I had gotten further, but still hadn&rsquo;t solved the problem.  Another question/discussion in the chat room and it became clear.  I was able to complete the lesson.  <strong>Happy Dance!</strong></p>

<p>I look forward to my next call with my mentor (tomorrow) and starting my next section &ndash; Rails Foundation.  As I progress through each section I&rsquo;ll return here to provide updates.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/04/bad-cs-vs-good-cs/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-04T21:16:26-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/04/bad-cs-vs-good-cs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why is bad customer service still an issue in the present day?  I realize we had to put up with it in the past whether it was due to lack of competition, or a lack of a way to widely communicate our experience.  But in the age of the Internet, and lightspeed communications, what the hell?</p>

<p>I know this isn&rsquo;t about programming, but every once in a while I will chat about general topics.  This past week I got to experience both bad and good customer service.  I was shocked actually becuase the bad service was from American Express.  I&rsquo;ve never had an issue with them until this past week.  I&rsquo;ve been an American Express member for over 20 years.  Last year and the year before I used my card for purchases in excess, well let&rsquo;s just say greater than $20k each year.  I make my payments online via the American Express website.  This past time I made an error.  I didn&rsquo;t catch that I used my business account instead of my personal account.  When Amex went to transfer the money, there wasn&rsquo;t enough in the business account.  They emailed me a the next day.  A day after that I got a letter from my credit union letting me know that Amex tried to transfer money and since I didn&rsquo;t have enough, they hit me with a fee.</p>

<p>So I called Amex.  First person said, &ldquo;&hellip;sorry, nothing I can do.  We will keep trying to hit that account up to three times.&rdquo;  Oh and they will charge me a fee each time it fails.  And, my bank will charge me a fee each time it fails.  Now I realize I made a mistake.  But seriously, Amex couldn&rsquo;t cancel the transaction?  I escalated to a supervisor and got the same response.  I told the supervisor that I wanted to file a formal complaint.  Their response &ndash; &ldquo;&hellip;noted, but there is nothing we can do.&rdquo;  ARGH!</p>

<p>So I called my credit union (bank) to see if I would have better luck.  They were a little confused at first because they thought I didn&rsquo;t want to pay.  I did want to pay, but I needed to use the right account and I didn&rsquo;t want to keep getting dinged by both sides.  The Vystar rep helped me out and provided a solution.  1.)  File a stop payment to block the Amex transaction.  2.) Helped me transfer the money Amex was trying to get from my personal account to business account.  The reason being was in case the block didn&rsquo;t take affect quick enough, there would be money for Amex to get and no more penalty fees.  In addition, the Vystar rep reversed the charges/fees that occurred from their end.  Now that is Customer Service!</p>

<p>But wait, there is more!  After providing a solution, the rep said &ldquo;&hellip;you know we have a promo now for our bank card.  Would you like to get one?&rdquo;  And I did.  All future transactions where I used to use my Amex will now be done with my Vystar Card.</p>

<p>What I find worse than bad customer service, is customer service that just ignores you.  Before I began my journey with Ruby and Rails, I was trying to build upon my knowledge of PHP.  I purchased a book, <em>&ldquo;Easy PHP Websites with The Zend Framework,&rdquo;</em> by W. Jason Gilmore.  I found this book not very good &ndash; a little better than the phpCake one I had tried, but not worthy of the money I had spent.  I reached out on several occasions to get a refund.  I was ignored.  Contrast that horrible experience to a good one that happened this week.  I had heard about the book <em>Geocoding on Rails</em> by the folks at Thoughtbot.  I was very excited because from what I had heard, this book might help with a hurdle I had been trying to leap in my own app.  I got the book and tried to follow.  Had some trouble.  Tried again a few other times when I thought I was more alert.  Still didn&rsquo;t help.  Then I came to realize that I had made a mistake &ndash; I thought the book would take the reader from start to finish of a Geolocation Rails app.  But the book is geared more so to explain the different concepts and ways to approach Geolocation in a Rails app.  In other words &ndash; it was above my level, above my pay grade.</p>

<p>I reached out to Thoughtbot and asked for a refund.  Not only did they promptly refund my money, but they encouraged me to revisit once I get a bit further along in my Ruby studies.  I&rsquo;m sure the book, and some others they offer, will be of better value to me once I gain more knowledge.</p>

<p>Customer Service need not be hard.  I&rsquo;m not saying the customer is always right.  But the customer pays the bills.  In the case of Amex, I would have been ok if all they had said was: &ldquo;&hellip;no problem, I&rsquo;ll stop that transaction for you.&rdquo;  Reversing the penalty would have been a bonus, but I&rsquo;d be ok with them just stopping the offending transaction.</p>

<p>Amex, you&rsquo;ve lost a long time customer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Us geeks love our gadgets.  I had heard just bits and pieces about something called a Raspberry Pi.  I hadn&rsquo;t given much thought to it at first.  A brief glance at a web page or two but it didn&rsquo;t interest me at that time.  I was having a hard time picturing what I could do with it.</p>

<p>What peaked my interest was a re-introduction to the Pi, and other similar devices, at Ruby Conf 2013 (Miami.)  The gadgets like the Raspberry Pi were used in some of the conference talks.  I also got hooked on the Sphero, but is another story.</p>

<p>After Ruby Conf I started researching the Pi some more.  I came across a site that seemed to have a lot about the Raspberry Pi, and other geek related topics &ndash; <a href="http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi/getstartedwithpi?ICID=getstartpi-videodoc5-getstartedlink">http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi/getstartedwithpi?ICID=getstartpi-videodoc5-getstartedlink</a></p>

<p>I watched some of the videos on the element14 site and my brain was invigorated.  The wheels started spinning.  So I ordered one of the Raspberry Pi Starter Pack.  In addition to the Pi, it came with a memory card, jumpers, USB WiFi, bread board, etc.  I grabbed mine from a site I found on the element14 page &ndash; <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/category/105">http://www.adafruit.com/category/105</a>  I added on the USB Wifi and a cool ruler.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only just begun to tinker with it, but so far it has been fun.  Using the NOOB tool, I loaded up a 4GB card with the Pi version of the XBMC.</p>

<p>I plan on doing some more experimentation.  I picked up 4 new SD cards, two 8GB and two 16GB so I can try different loads and setups.  Plus I&rsquo;m getting the kids involved so they can learn a little bit of geeky stuff.</p>

<p>Recommendation &ndash; grab a slice of pie, Raspberry Pi!</p>

    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/02/28/in-search-of-mentor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I began my journey to become a better programmer, I didn&rsquo;t have a clear path.  I had been programming in Perl for my day job, and I have ideas sketched out for some web and mobile apps.  Most the programming I do at work is for single task automation or data lookup.  I want to be a better programmer at work, and I want to see my ideas in use for myself and others.</p>

<p>I reached out to a friend of mine in early 2012.  I shared with him some of my buisness and software ideas.  He has a lot of experience as an entrepreneur, and as a software developer.  When I finally settled on working on my software projects, we had several discussion sessions together and he helped point me in a direction.  I started to learn the Zend framework as I had some previous experience hacking away at php based websites.  My progress went slow, buy my friend, Bill, helped to gently nudge me in the appropriate direction and answer my battery of questions.  I&rsquo;m sure it must have been tough for him as I had a lot of questions and kept switching what I was trying to focus on.</p>

<p>Fast forward to about this time in 2013.  I was a little frustrated with myself and slow progress.  It took me a real long time to get the user registration and login part of my app working.  I realized that I had major gaps in core programming knowledge.  Using Amazon.com I found some books to study (see my post &ldquo;To Book or Not to Book&rdquo;.)  While reading one of these books I ran into a guy who was the catalyst in rebooting my programming journey.  He, Shane, introduced me to Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Shane told me about some online resources to help get me started &ndash; the ones at CodeSchool and RailsCasts.  I went back to Amazon and ordered the Hartl book.  With my nose in the books, laptop comfortably on my lap, I started studying Ruby and Rails.  The beginner resources I came across were excellent.  I found a much better selection of books and online resources from the Ruby community, especially compared to PHP which I had previously been studying.  My &ldquo;home schooling&rdquo; was going well.</p>

<p>What took me over a month to learn and do in PHP, the user registration/login code of my website, I was able to learn and complete in a weekend using Rails.  For me, learning Ruby and Rails is actually fun.  I feel that I have been able to comprehend the basics, and some intermediate stuff pretty well just by reading or watching online videos (both free and paid for.)  But I&rsquo;ve noticed that I&rsquo;m starting to hit some more challenging concepts and material.</p>

<p>My application has some models that aren&rsquo;t as simple as a one-to-one, or one-to-many relationship.  My app needs to interact with the user for more than just simple data entry. I&rsquo;m seeing that I need to learn more about JavaScript/CoffeeScript and jQuery.  I&rsquo;m having issues with Geolocation.  The concepts are getting a little more complicated for me.  I need someone to talk to and work through these challenges.  I need a more structured learning environment where I&rsquo;m able to ask questions for topics I do not understand.  Thus my search for more knowledge.</p>

<p>Since I work full time, I had some contraints to work within.  Either I needed to find some programming courses at a local college, that I could attend at night, or find some on-line resource.  While I find my subscriptions to CodeSchool, RailsCasts and PluralSight useful, the draw back is I can&rsquo;t ask questions when I get stuck.  Off to Google I went to start my search.  I was overwhelmed by how many different solutions there are.  One can review a pretty good list of solutions at the Quora site <a href="http://www.quora.com/Programming-Bootcamps/What-are-the-short-term-3-12mo-development-bootcamps-academies-around-the-world">http://www.quora.com/Programming-Bootcamps/What-are-the-short-term-3-12mo-development-bootcamps-academies-around-the-world</a></p>

<p>Some of the more popular sites I found were, in no particular order: <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com/">http://www.launchacademy.com/</a>  <a href="http://www.appacademy.io/">http://www.appacademy.io/</a> <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/">http://www.thinkful.com/</a>  <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/">http://www.gotealeaf.com/</a>  <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">http://devbootcamp.com/</a> <a href="https://www.bloc.io/">https://www.bloc.io/</a>  <a href="https://training.bignerdranch.com">https://training.bignerdranch.com</a>  <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/">http://www.hackreactor.com/</a> and <a href="https://learn.thoughtbot.com/">https://learn.thoughtbot.com/</a></p>

<p>Off the above though, only four seemed to fit my criteria of being able to attend on-line, at my own time: Bloc, Thinkful, Teaeaf Academy and Thoughbot.  The pricing for these courses are roughly in the same price range, with Bloc being the most expensive.  But Bloc costs more for a good reason I feel &ndash; more time with a mentor.  I talked with people from Bloc and Thinkful &ndash; both of them had a live session to code with a mentor.  Bloc seems more proactive in having numerous info sessions and answering questions from potential students.</p>

<p>Through my research and conversations, I&rsquo;ve narrowed my search down to Bloc and Tealeaf.  Tealeaf is getting a strong consideration because one of their founders is a Hashrocket alumni which I found out about after talking with two folks from Hashrocket.  But Bloc is the leader and I&rsquo;ve pre-registered with them.  I wish Tealeaf had hosted some info sessions so I could get a taste of how they work.  I&rsquo;m still considering them as their course is broken down into 3 components, with the last one covering advanced concepts.  Upon completion of Bloc, I may enroll in that third course.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had exposure to three mentors at Bloc.  Each one has impressed me.  Keep an eye out for my follow up posts regarding how my training goes with Bloc.  I have a mentor in mind, but I will not know for sure until I get through the formal registration and enrollment.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I ran into a former co-worker the other day &ndash; someone that I hadn&rsquo;t seen since I left my previous assignment back in 2008.  They looked at me in a surprising way and at first I wasn&rsquo;t sure why.  Had I changed that much in a few short years?  Then it hit me,
the last time I saw this person, I was 60 pounds heavier!</p>

<p>Back in 2008 I had probably hit the height of feeling like crap.  The job I was in was stressing me out and then we found out that our contract was not going to be renewed.  Although the job was not making me happy, the thought of being unemployed was worse.  Tack on to that, I kept gaining weight over the years and I was having health problems.</p>

<p>I kept getting sick and having a hard time breathing.  I was coughing all the time, and though I deny it, the wife says my snoring could rattle the dishes.  I saw several doctors, and specialists.  They ran tests on me, put me in some type of chamber to measure how I breathed.  Nothing was fixing my problem.  The only relief came from cough syrup, assorted pills and some breathing medication.</p>

<p>In 2009 I started a new job, one that I&rsquo;m still at and very happy with.  The stress from the old job was gone, but the fat was still sticking around.  We had a family trip planned to go to Hong Kong in December.  Hong Kong is a very dynamic city and I wouldn&rsquo;t have my crutch of a car/truck to shuttle my fat ass around with.  I&rsquo;d have to walk and use the mass transit.</p>

<p>In August of 2009 I finally admitted to myself, partly because I saw that I couldn&rsquo;t keep up with my kids and partly because I saw a picture of myself, that I really needed to loose weight.  I did some research and came across a program called &ldquo;Quick Weight Loss&rdquo; which can be found at: <a href="http://quickweightloss.net">http://quickweightloss.net</a>  They had locations in some cities where you could go for consultation and get advice on what plan(s) to use.  But I wasn&rsquo;t located in any of those cities.  Luckily, they had an at-home program.  I signed up and started the plan in September 2009.</p>

<p>By the time we left for Hong Kong, in mid-December, I had lost 50 pounds and was feeling great!  I only gained 2 pounds while on vacation in Hong Kong, though I ate whatever I wanted.  One gets plenty of excercise getting around that city.  When I returned to the states, I went back on my program and lost another 10 pounds for a total loss of 60 pounds.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2013.  I have gained a little of the weight back.  We had a family cruise this past December, and I ate a lot of great food.  I&rsquo;ve lost some of that weight on my own.  Occasionlly I&rsquo;ll jumpstart my weight correction by going back on the QWL plan.  Thankfully though, it is usually just for 2 weeks so I can loose that naughty weight and get back to my desired numbers.</p>

<p>Did I mention all those health problems I was having are now gone?  Not only did a loose those pesky pounds, I also lost all of the health problems I was having.  And although I still say that I don&rsquo;t snore, my wife says that it is much &ldquo;lighter&rdquo; than it was.</p>

<p>Working in the tech field may seem to present challenges in staying fit.  We basically sit all day to earn a living.  But I&rsquo;m encouraging you to watch your weight and loose those pesky pounds.  While at work, stand up every 30-45 minutes and stretch out.  Stay standing for 5-10 minutes and get then get back to work.  Maybe get one of those desks that can go up and down &ndash; I have my eye on this one: <a href="http://www.nextdesks.com/terra">http://www.nextdesks.com/terra</a></p>

<p>So, get up and Drop that Bass, er, Fat!</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/02/24/dissect-a-method-part-ii/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-24T20:48:10-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/02/24/dissect-a-method-part-ii</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a week ago I created the &ldquo;Dissect A Method&rdquo; post.  Near the end of that post
I felt like I left things hanging.  So I&rsquo;m going to try and clear things up.  I ended that post mostly because I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable with what is going on in the line of code that looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>decimal.gsub!(/\d{3}(?!$)/,'\0,')</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I did a some research &ndash; a little dive into the API, <a href="http://apidock.com/ruby/String/gsub">http://apidock.com/ruby/String/gsub</a> and a trip over to a cool RegEx site, <a href="http://rubular.com/">http://rubular.com/</a></p>

<p>If you would like follow along, go to the rubular site and enter the following into the text box for &lsquo;Your regular expression:&rsquo;</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>\d{3}(?!$)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the text box for &lsquo;Your test string:&rsquo; we will try a few different values.  Go ahead and test a few numbers, one at a time, e.g. 45789  AND  1024  AND  54 AND  5251350</p>

<p>Observe your results in the &lsquo;Match result:&rsquo; text box.  So the beginning of our regex is composed of \d{3} which says that we are looking for 3 digits &ndash; any number 0 thru 9.  The next part is what had me stuck.  I seemed to recall that the $ meant End of line, and we can confirm that by looking at the RegEx quick reference on the rubular site.</p>

<p>But what heck is this ?! stuff?  These two characters mean Negative lookahead.  So we are going to the end of the line of the string and then looking <em>backwards</em> to get a group of three digits.</p>

<p>Ok, so what does that last part mean, the &lsquo;\0,&rsquo; ?  Taking a look on the apidock site, I found an explanation &ndash; Interpolating.  For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># replace /ll/ with itself
</span><span class='line'>'hello'.gsub(/ll/, '\0') # returns 'hello'
</span><span class='line'>'hello'.gsub(/ll/, "\0") # returns 'he\000o'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Putting the pieces together, if matched, we would grab some digits, and replace them with the same digits <em>plus</em> a comma, thus helping us to create a pretty integer.</p>

<p>Using a combination of the rubular site, and irb, try out the example for the number 1249580.  As we will see in the irb shortly, the first digit will be extracted as the leader.  So in rubular, just enter the number 249580.  Notice how in rubular the digits 249 are highlighted.  These numbers will have themselves replaced with 249, once we do the interpolating.</p>

<p>Ok, lets take this to the irb!</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.1.0 :001 &gt; decimal = Integer(1249580).to_s
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "1249580"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :002 &gt; leader = decimal.slice!(0, decimal.length % 3)
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "1"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :003 &gt; decimal.gsub!(/\d{3}(?!$)/,'\0,')
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "249,580"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :004 &gt; decimal = nil if decimal.empty?
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; nil
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :005 &gt; leader  = nil if leader.empty?
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; nil
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :006 &gt;
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :007 &gt;   [leader,decimal].compact.join(",")
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "1,249,580"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :008 &gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I hope this follow up post has helped to illustrate how all the components of our original method of dissection work.  Going through the research and stepping through a few examples has helped me a lot.</p>
