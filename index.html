  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have many learning tools in my arsenal including Code School, Thoughtbot/Upcase, RailsCasts, Ruby Tapas, and too many other Internet based free resources to list.  But today I want to talk tapas, and borrow something that I learned from watching many episodes of Ruby Tapas.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve watched various episodes, I kept saying to myself, how is Avdi executing code right from within his text editor?  Is this some time of post production trickery?  Perhaps a green screen based laptop with a dash of After Effects?  But after some research, I learned that is wasn&rsquo;t some fancy magic, but rather an ability within his editor.  I believe that editor to be Emacs.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a Sublime Text user, and slowly dabbling with Vim.  So off to the online oracles to see if I could find a solution that would work in Sublime.  I did indeed find some solutions that said they were doing what Avdi can do &ndash; even referencing that they had the same desire as me.  However, I was not successful with getting Sublime to work the way I was expecting.  After spending several hours trying to force it to work, I gave up.  And I had a thought &ndash; surely this would be easier to get working with Vim.  :)</p>

<p>Getting the Tapas style in-line Ruby code execution to work in Vim was nice and easy.  I followed the instructions <a href="http://commandercoriander.net/blog/2012/10/10/evaluate-lines-of-ruby-in-vim/">here</a> and was up in running with very little effort.  For those that don&rsquo;t want leave from this fabulous reading, I&rsquo;ll summarize what needs to be done, first starting with the installation of a gem:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem install rcodetools</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we need to add a plugin to Vim.  Depending on your setup, you may need to add the .vim/bundle directory in your home directory.  But I already had this setup, so all I needed to do was the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cd ~
</span><span class='line'>cd .vim/bundle
</span><span class='line'>git clone https://github.com/t9md/vim-ruby-xmpfilter.git</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For a final bit of setup/configuration, we need to take a trip in editing the ~/.vimrc or ~/.vimrc.local file so we can do some mapping:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>nmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F4&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-mark)
</span><span class='line'>xmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F4&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-mark)
</span><span class='line'>imap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F4&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-mark)
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>nmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F5&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-run)
</span><span class='line'>xmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F5&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-run)
</span><span class='line'>imap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F5&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-run)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The above mapping will allows us to mark (F4) what line(s) we want to see the results for of executing the ruby code, which we accomplish by pressing F5.  Let&rsquo;s step through an example to see how this works.  I&rsquo;ll show the example file through the various stages.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>1 class Person
</span><span class='line'>2   attr_accessor :name, :age
</span><span class='line'>3
</span><span class='line'>4   def initialize(name)
</span><span class='line'>5     self.name = name
</span><span class='line'>6     self.age = "Does it matter?"
</span><span class='line'>7   end
</span><span class='line'>8 end
</span><span class='line'>9
</span><span class='line'>10 p = Person.new('Kevin')
</span><span class='line'>11 p.name
</span><span class='line'>12 p.age</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next we will press F4 for the code we want to evaluate, line 11 below:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>1 class Person
</span><span class='line'>2   attr_accessor :name, :age
</span><span class='line'>3
</span><span class='line'>4   def initialize(name)
</span><span class='line'>5     self.name = name
</span><span class='line'>6     self.age = "Does it matter?"
</span><span class='line'>7   end
</span><span class='line'>8 end
</span><span class='line'>9
</span><span class='line'>10 p = Person.new('Kevin')
</span><span class='line'>11 p.name # =&gt;
</span><span class='line'>12 p.age</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And finally, EXECUTE (F5):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>1 class Person
</span><span class='line'>2   attr_accessor :name, :age
</span><span class='line'>3
</span><span class='line'>4   def initialize(name)
</span><span class='line'>5     self.name = name
</span><span class='line'>6     self.age = "Does it matter?"
</span><span class='line'>7   end
</span><span class='line'>8 end
</span><span class='line'>9
</span><span class='line'>10 p = Person.new('Kevin')
</span><span class='line'>11 p.name # =&gt; "Kevin"
</span><span class='line'>12 p.age</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Pretty neat, eh?  Borrowing this workflow from Ruby Tapas will now help me when I&rsquo;m following along with each episode.  Now I just need to get better with Vim.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of my Rails projects, for personal use and education, have been using Postgresql or SQLite for the datbase backend.  At work our primary database is Oracle with a dash of MySQL.  Recently we decided to use MySQL with all future development, and migrate our tools/applications that use Oracle to use MySQL.</p>

<p>I downloaded and installed MySQL by grabbing the installer from the MySQL website:  <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/</a> and getting the version for my operating system &ndash; OS X Mavericks.</p>

<p>However, with this version installed I was having issues with bundler and getting the mysql gem to compile.  I tried a few solutions that I found on the internet, but none of them were working.</p>

<p>I found some other people who had issues, when using OSX Mavericks, with the MySQL installer.  They solved the issue by removing MySQL that was installed from the download via dev.mysql.com and then re-installing using Homebrew.</p>

<p>This solution worked for me as well.  I found this a bit odd, because earlier in the year I had issues with installing Postgres via Homebrew.  The solution for Postgres was to remove the Homebrew installation and use the installer from the Postgres site.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While working on a Rails project last week I encountered an issue where some of my tests were failing.  It had been a while since I worked on this project so I had to re-familiarize myself with what was going on.</p>

<p>The tests were failing when editing a profile and adding an image.  I popped over to the browser and performed a manual test to get a better idea of what was going on.  That is when I saw the following error: <em>&ldquo;Paperclip::Errors::NotIdentifiedByImageMagickError&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>To attempt to fix the issue, I first performed a simple uninstall and re-install of imagemagic using homebrew:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>brew uninstall imagemagick
</span><span class='line'>brew install imagemagick</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This didn&rsquo;t solve the problem.  Imagemagic has a command line utility, convert, which one can use to see if the application is working.  I tried a simple test:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>convert moonie.jpg moon.png</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But I continued to get errors even with that simple test.  So off to the internet for some deep research.  I came across the following steps, which solved the issue I was having.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>brew update
</span><span class='line'>brew doctor
</span><span class='line'>brew uninstall libtool
</span><span class='line'>brew uninstall imagemagic
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>cd /Library/Caches/Homebrew
</span><span class='line'>rm imagemag*
</span><span class='line'>rm libtool-2.4.2.tar.gz
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>brew doctor
</span><span class='line'>brew install libtool --universal
</span><span class='line'>brew link libool --force
</span><span class='line'>brew install imagemagic --build-from-source</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After completing the above steps, the command line tool, convert was successful.  I re-tested the Rails application, both manually, and via my test suite, and all was green again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I covered a topic that resurfaced while I am in the process of upgrading one of our apps from Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.x. When I wrote that application I was a raw recruit &ndash; fresh to Ruby and Rails and just trying to get the idea to work.</p>

<p>But as I&rsquo;ve been improving my skills and expanding the ole grey matter, I wanted to write this new version, fully tested.  In the application there is a need to be able to export the data to a CSV formatted file.  I had the code from the old version of the app, and migrated it over.  However, I challenged myself to figure out how to write a test for the to_csv method in Baytech model.</p>

<p>Below is the code from the Baytech model:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def self.to_csv
</span><span class='line'>  CSV.generate(col_sep: ':') do |csv|
</span><span class='line'>    all.each do |baytech|
</span><span class='line'>      port = "X"
</span><span class='line'>      csv &lt;&lt; [baytech.name, baytech.phone_num, baytech.ip_addr, port, baytech.modem_type, port]
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I know the method works, as it has been working fine for 9 months or so now.  But I really wanted to figure out how to write a test for this method.  After much trial and error, along with research via books and google, I came up with the following solution:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>describe Baytech, '#to_csv' do
</span><span class='line'>  let(:baytech) { FactoryGirl.create(:baytech) }
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  before do
</span><span class='line'>    baytech
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  it { expect(Baytech.to_csv).to match /#{baytech.name}:#{baytech.phone_num}:#{baytech.ip_addr}:X:1:X/ }
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You may notice in the above code that I am referencing a Factory.  Here is a short version of that factory file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>FactoryGirl.define do
</span><span class='line'>  factory :baytech do
</span><span class='line'>    sequence(:name) {|n| "jaxfl0#{n}b9" }
</span><span class='line'>    sequence(:ip_addr) {|n| "10.1.2.#{n}" }
</span><span class='line'>    phone_num "7091234384"
</span><span class='line'>    region "USA"
</span><span class='line'>    modem_type "1"
</span><span class='line'>    ip_method "ssh"
</span><span class='line'>    active true
</span><span class='line'>    has_modem_line true
</span><span class='line'>    updated_by "cd1234"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    {-snip-}
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The keen eye may have caught something interesting in the to_csv method.  I&rsquo;m using an option, col_sep: &lsquo;:&rsquo; which allows me to use the : character as the delimiter instead of the default comma.</p>

<p>With the test in place, and passing, I felt better about the code in my to_csv method.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I re-discovered an issue I ran into about 8 months ago.  I am re-writing an application I created for work.  The first version was written in Ruby 1.9.x and Rails 3.x.  I built the app using sticks and glue &ndash; no testing.</p>

<p>We are migrating to Ruby 2.1.x and Rails 4.1.x and rather than copy over the app and tweak it, I wanted to take a better approach, a TDD approach.</p>

<p>It is a pretty simple application, with two main models &ndash; Baytech and Device.  A Baytech can have zero to many devices, and a device should only belong to one baytech.</p>

<p>To frameout my two models I used the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rails g model baytech
</span><span class='line'>rails g model device</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Everything seemed fine at first.  Until I started writing tests and code then I re-discovered a blast from the past.  What I didn&rsquo;t catch was that Rails, with its vast knowledge, pluralized both baytech and device as:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>bayteches</li>
<li>devices</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, all is cool with the plural version of device as devices.  But the plural of baytech is baytechs.  Oh crap, what do I do?</p>

<p>The first time this happened to me, it took me a while to figure out what the heck was going on.  Eventually all roads led me to the file config/initializers/inflections.rb</p>

<p>Taking a look inside this file, I found the following, or something similar:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
</span><span class='line'># are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
</span><span class='line'># locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
</span><span class='line'># ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, '\1en'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, '\1'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.irregular 'person', 'people'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.uncountable %w( fish sheep )
</span><span class='line'># end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
</span><span class='line'># ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.acronym 'RESTful'
</span><span class='line'># end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To cure my issue, I had to make one small change to this file, making use of inflect.irregular:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>  inflect.irregular 'baytech', 'baytechs'
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once that change was made, anytime there was a need for the plural version of baytech, Rails knew to use baytechs.  Yeah!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had the joy of installing Oracle 11g Express Edition on my home server.  That server runs CentOS 6.x as that is the flavor of Linux we use at my day job.  The server install is another story I will cover in the future, but today I would like to share how I got my laptop and development environment setup to connect to the Oracle Database.</p>

<p>Why in the world would I want to use Oracle you ask?  Well I don&rsquo;t really want to.  However, at the day job, that is what we use. And I wanted a more flexible development environment.  Due to limited resources, our &lsquo;dev&rsquo; database is also our disaster recovery database.  &lsquo;Nuff said?</p>

<p>In order to get my ruby environment setup to work with this monster database, I need two gems:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter', '~&gt; 1.5.0'
</span><span class='line'>gem 'ruby-oci8', '~&gt; 2.1.0'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a href="https://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced">Oracle Enhanced</a></p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself.  Lets take two steps back.</p>

<h2>Download some files</h2>

<p>On my server I have installed Oracle 11g Express, and my laptop is fairly current and run OS X Mavericks &ndash; a 64bit Operating System.  So let&rsquo;s get the appropriate client.</p>

<p>Download the required files from the Oracle Download site:
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/intel-macsoft-096467.html">Oracle Client</a></p>

<p>Note:  The following was learned by reviewing the blog over at: <a href="http://blog.codiez.co.za/2013/09/setup-oracle-instant-client-ruby-oci8-gem-mac/">codiez</a></p>

<p>For me, I downloaded these files:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>instantclient-sqlplus-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>instantclient-sdk-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Change to the directory where you downloaded the files
(e.g. cd Downloads &ndash; assuming you are in your home directory)</p>

<p>Unzip the three files:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-sqlplus-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-sdk-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Change directories to the new one created by the unzipping:
cd instantclient_11_2</p>

<p>Perform the following steps:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>mv * /usr/local/oracle/product/instantclient_64/11.2.0.4.0/bin/</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, we need to create and modify the tnsnames.org file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir -p /usr/local/oracle/admin/network
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>touch /usr/local/oracle/admin/network/tnsnames.ora
</span><span class='line'>vim /usr/local/oracle/admin/network/tnsnames.ora
</span><span class='line'>rubyrailssvr =
</span><span class='line'>  (DESCRIPTION =
</span><span class='line'>    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 192.168.1.14)(PORT = 1521))
</span><span class='line'>    (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVICE_NAME = XE))
</span><span class='line'>  )
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>rubyrailssvr.homenet.com =
</span><span class='line'>  (DESCRIPTION =

</span><span class='line'>    (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVICE_NAME = XE))
</span><span class='line'>  )</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we need to get our environment setup. Create a .oracle_client file in your home directory:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>touch ~/.oracle_client
</span><span class='line'>vim ~/.oracle_client
</span><span class='line'>export ORACLE_BASE=/usr/local/oracle
</span><span class='line'>export ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/instantclient_64/11.2.0.4.0
</span><span class='line'>export PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
</span><span class='line'>export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
</span><span class='line'>export TNS_ADMIN=$ORACLE_BASE/admin/network
</span><span class='line'>export SQLPATH=$ORACLE_HOME/sqlplus/admin</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I use the bash shell at work, but have been working with zsh at home lately.  So below I show how to add the above oracle environment variables to both bash and zsh:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>echo "source ~/.oracle_client" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</span><span class='line'>source ~/.bash_profile
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>echo "source ~/.oracle_client" &gt;&gt; ~/.zprofile
</span><span class='line'>source ~/.zprofile</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Optional step &ndash; if needed, you may need to update your /etc/hosts file so that you can resolve the IP address of your server to a fully qualified domain name.  See the following example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>192.168.1.14    rubyrailssvr.homenet.com</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We are almost there &ndash; go take a break if you need to.  Before we update our Gemfile to add the two gems I listed earlier, let&rsquo;s first test and make sure we can connect.  We will use sqlplus to perform that test, which is a tool that was installed as part of the instant client.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>➜  ~  sqlplus system@192.168.1.14

<p>You should be able to connect now, though I have made a huge assumption.  I have assumed that your Oracle DB is currently configured to accept remote connections.</p>

<p>Well that wraps up todays episode.  Get out there and &hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been bad.  I let myself get consumed by my attendance of the on-line course at Bloc, and spending a lot of after-work-hours working on my personal project.  I have neglected my writing, and I apologize for my absence.</p>

<p>Earlier today I received notification from Disquis that someone, Nalani, had submitted a comment.  I am grateful for that comment as it reminded me of absence from this blog.  So with that nice kick-in-the-pants, let&rsquo;s move forward.</p>

<p>I completed my on-line training of the Bloc.io course on June 9th 2014.  Overall I was satisfied with the training and can confidently recommend it to others, depending on their situation.  What?</p>

<p>Bloc is not for everyone.  The first barrier to overcome is the cost.  I believe I got in before the price increase so the tuition was around $4250 if memory serves me correctly.  I believe the price to be fair for what you get.  However, I would not suggest that anyone plop down that money if they are currently struggling financially.</p>

<p>Depending on your employment needs, Bloc may not be for you.  For me, I took the course to better my programming skills and to assist me move forward with my personal project.  But I would not say that what I learned would allow me to get a job similar to what I have now, at my current pay rate.  I think the education would help one land a junior-developer job or an internship at a dev shop.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert, but from my experience with local dev shops here, there is a heavy emphasis on testing and Test-Drive-Development(TDD.)  And when I took the Bloc course, that area was lacking.  You can see my previous post for more information.</p>

<p>Yesterday I received an email from Bloc that indicated that they improving the Full Stack program by adding more testing to the course.  Not sure if it was my feedback, or feedback from many of us past students, but I&rsquo;m glad to see that they continuously improve on their product.</p>

<p>Is Bloc for you?  Maybe.  If you are like me, someone who has a day job and wanted to improve their programming skills, while trying to bring your product idea to life, then yes.  Maybe you are someone with a great idea, a founder, and want to get a better grip on what it will take to produce your product.  I think Bloc can help you there.  If you are trying to break ground in the industry and land your first job or internship, then yes, I think Bloc is for you.  If you need the extra hand holding while learning the basics, then yes I think you will get value from the Bloc program.</p>

<p>I do want to end with a note about the mentorship, and you may have read into my words at the end of the last paragraph.  If you are seeking what I consider advance knowledge and/or assistance, you may be dissapointed.  While I found the mentorship to be very helpful at the beginning and middle of my training, I was dissapointed at the end when it came to my capstone project.  Fortunately for me, about 8 weeks in to my Bloc training, I met a guy, Shaun, who became my &lsquo;external-mentor.&rsquo;  If not for him, I would not have been able to complete some of the Bloc assignments the way I wanted &ndash; via TDD.  Sure I could have completed them, but I want to develop by writing tests first.  Shaun has also helped me with my personal project and taken it so much farther than I could have done on my own.  What I&rsquo;m trying to end with is this &ndash; no matter if you take the training at Bloc or else where, find a mentor who will spend the time with you to help you learn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Picking up from where I left off with my block experience (see previous post, Week 2 and a half at Bloc,) a lot of good things, and some bad things, have occurred.  I had finished, what was called at the time, the third block, which included lessons on RSpec, Testing Users and both creating and destroying using Ajax.</p>

<p>The end of Block Three took me a bit longer to complete compared to how I progressed through the first two blocks.  The material in the third block was new to me.  It was during the end of this block, and creeping into the beginning of block four that I began to have issues with my mentor.  In the first two blocks, since I didn&rsquo;t need much help, I didn&rsquo;t mind that our sessions tended to be brief.  Usually they ran up to 10 minutes.  But our sessions are booked for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>My mentor during this time had missed a some meetings and had asked me to reschedule a few times.  I&rsquo;m flexible so I didn&rsquo;t see an issue.  But there was one time that I needed to reschedule and the mentor wouldn&rsquo;t work with me to make up the time.  Time much needed as I was having trouble with the project I had selected in Block Four &ndash; Saas Wiki Collaboration Tool.  I was getting very frustrated.</p>

<p>I reached out to student coordinator at Bloc, Karen, and discussed the issues I was having.  I explained that in the beggining I had gotten ahead, but now with all the problems I was encountering with this mentor, I was getting behind.  And I felt it very disrepectful that I was asked on several occasions to modify my schedule for him, but the one time I needed a re-schedule, he didn&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>Karen helped me out and let me pick out a new mentor.  She said that they would add a week to my enrollment to help make up for some of the lost time.  (Think I need to check on that because it doesn&rsquo;t look like they added a week.)  The new mentor, Charlie, was a huge improvment.  Never did I feel like he was trying to get me off the phone.  In fact, on several calls we went over the scheduled 30 minutes.</p>

<p>While working with the new mentor, Charlie, has been a much better experience, I feel that there is something missing from the program.  Although it is said that students will do pair programming and testing, I don&rsquo;t find either to come near what I was expecting.  It may be that my expectations are set to high from what the folks at Bloc had planned to offer.  I can understand that they have a range of differently skilled students.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m far off in saying that most newbies to this program probably don&rsquo;t care as much about testing as I do.</p>

<p>I find this mediocre approach to testing to transcend into the help one would get in the Office Hours Chat room.  I&rsquo;ll provide a brief example.  I was stuck on how to write a test that would make sure that any user, other than a logged in user, would not be able to access the ability to upgrade a users account by direct url navigation.  When I posed my question the answer I got was that I should use Pundit&rsquo;s policies and don&rsquo;t display the upgrade button unless the user is logged in and allowed to upgrade.</p>

<p>I had explained that I had already written tests for that, and the code to make the tests green, but I wanted to ensure that a malicous user would not be able to access the url for an upgrade directly.  The short answer I got was &ldquo;&hellip;well the users shouldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;  Yeah, well credit card thieves should not steal peoples credit card info and identies either, but I&rsquo;m sure the credit card companies do whatever they can to protect against those thieves.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t think the program was meant to take testing as seriously as I am.  It seems the program gives one just enough to say, &ldquo;&hellip; yeah I know how to test with RSpec.&rdquo;  Although I&rsquo;m happy with my mentor Charlie, I felt a bit frustrated on our calls when trying to work through testing issues.  So frustrated in fact that I stopped testing the proper way and just worked on trying to complete the assignment.</p>

<p>Bloc changed the student dashboard and I got really worried.  I was reviewing where I was in the program and the dashboard was telling me that I was behind.  The dashboard lists 5 projects, including the one I was working on, Saas Wiki Collaboration.  The sixth project is for our capstone.  Seeing that I had only four weeks left, and still hadn&rsquo;t finished this Wiki project, I got a bit frazzled.  It is not like I haven&rsquo;t been putting in the time!</p>

<p>On my mentoring call with Charlie last Friday I asked what the deal was.  There was no way I could finish all those projects and have time for my capstone.  My previous mentor had said that I only needed to pick one if I wanted to spend more time on the capstone project.  Luckily, Charlie confirmed that the dashboard was a bit confusing.  Students have the option to do more than one project before their capstone, but it is not required.</p>

<p>That made me feel a bit better, but I still needed to wrap up this Wiki project.  The main reason I took this course was to work on my capstone and have help when/where I needed via the mentorship and Office Hours Chat room.  Please don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I have learned a lot via the program, but my main goal is to work on my personal project.</p>

<p>With some &lsquo;external&rsquo; help, I was able to wrap up this Wiki project.  At least I believe it to be done according to the original requirements.  I even was able to get the Stripe intergration to work, with tests!  I&rsquo;ll have another blog post regarding the external help &ndash; stay tuned!</p>

<p>I have another mentoring call on Monday &ndash; 05/12/14.  We should be able to discuss my capstone project and get an idea of how to get started.  The nice thing about the Saas Wiki project is that there are a lot of components of that app which will apply to my capstone project.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more information regarding my experience at <a href="http://www.bloc.io">Bloc.io</a>  I will be publishing an overview of the program at the conclusion of enrollment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This evening I attended the RubyJax OpenHacks event at Lilly&rsquo;s Cafe out at the beach.  I believe the normal schedule has the OpenHacks event on the third Thursday of each month.  I like to get to th event a bit early as parking in that area can be a royal pain.</p>

<p>Shortly after I settled in, another new guy to the group, Jesse, joined me.  I had met Jesse a previous week at one of the Code &amp; Coffee events.  We got to talk a little bit about ourselves and what we were trying to accomplish in our quest of learning.</p>

<p>Enter the third n00b, Josh.  I was starting wonder if Micah has set the three of us in a fun game of snipe hunting.  Get all the new people together and laugh at them from a distance.  :)  The three of chatter a bit back and forth for a while, sharing some of our experiences.</p>

<p>One can learn from others that are new to Ruby, or anything for that matter.  For example, Jesse shared a neat tool he was using with me called Dash (<a href="http://kapeli.com/dash">http://kapeli.com/dash</a>).  This is a neat little app that sources the documentation of too many to count languages and frameworks.  I downloaded the app while he was demonstrating, and was excited to see all of the reference material available for the subjects I was interested in.  And then some!</p>

<p>I shared my current experience with Bloc.io and demonstrated their website, including a sample of some of the lessons I had completed and the one I had just started &ndash; my big project.  About this time Michah had showed up and I know that at least I felt at ease.  Micah had helped me before with some learning and I was hoping to pick his brain again.</p>

<p>Before we get to that though, Josh took a turn at sharing some resources.  The one that really stuck out to me was this website:  <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/">http://gitimmersion.com/</a>  I found this site to be a great resource, for the beginner, in learning how to use git.  So far I&rsquo;ve made it up to lab 14.  What I find really useful about this site is that I will be able to use the lessons on the site to help educate my fellow team workers at my day job.  Trying hard to get us all to use version control.</p>

<p>Just at I was getting ready to ask Micah a question, we had another join our group.  I was surprised, but very please to see Paolo Perrota join our group.  I think it is safe to say that all of use new guys were very happy to be hanging with two Ruby Gurus.</p>

<p>Rounding out the evening I reached out for some help with a coding issue I was having.  For the OOB Web app that I&rsquo;ve been developing for the day job, I need to support an older app.  This app uses the same data that I&rsquo;m migrating to the web app.  But the data in the files that support the app need to be delimited with a : and contain fields that we no longer need.  I had been able to figure out how to build that information as a : delimited export via the browser, but what I really needed was a rake task that could build two text files.</p>

<p>Working with Micah, he showed me where I was doing things correctly, and where I was making some mis-steps.  Using his guidance I was able to finish writing my second rake job &ndash; exporting the data.  I don&rsquo;t recall if I have mentioned it before, but Micah also helped me construct my first rake job &ndash; importing the data.</p>

<p>The time at Lilly&rsquo;s flew by, but I&rsquo;m confident in saying that all of us newbies learned something useful.  Looking forward to the next Code &amp; Coffee and OpenHacks events.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Day two was a rough start for me.  I over slept a little bit so I didn&rsquo;t have time to get breakfast at home.  Luckily, there was some breakfast provided at the conference.  I&rsquo;m not a big carb eater, but I knew that if I didn&rsquo;t eat something, it would be a rough day.  So down went a half bagel, some fruit, a glass of water and a coffee chaser.</p>

<p>Starting out the day was someone I had heard of, but never met &ndash; Terence Lee.  Terence works at Heroku as well as participates on the Ruby core team as a contributor.  I enjoyed this talk because I&rsquo;ve been using Heroku in my knowledge quest and found the topic to be relevant.  I think we sometimes take for granted what is going on behind the scenes, by guys like Terence, to ensure easy deployment of our apps.  In summary &ndash; make sure you are off of Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2.</p>

<p>For day two, I took the most notes during the second talk by Craig Kerstiens.  He talked about Postgres which is the primary database that I&rsquo;ve been using in my Rails applications.  Craig confirmed something that I had encountered two days earlier &ndash; don&rsquo;t use homebrew for Postgres.  Download and use the Postgres.app from their website.  I had a lot of issues during my workshop due to homebrew and its installation of Postgres.  Along with good tips for Postgres related resources, I also learned new stuff like sequential scan vs index scan.  And using Gin for indexing when you have multiple values in a column vs the standard BTree index method.  Rounding out his talk, I walked away with a to-do list of required research on HStore and jsonb.</p>

<p>Lunch on day two was the only part of the conference I didn&rsquo;t like.  I am not a pasta fan at all and sadly didn&rsquo;t find much I could eat.  I ended up snacking on two pieces of cheese and a chunk of bread.  Where the meal failed for me, the desert was a home run!  So I filled up on desert and coffee.  Yup, I was a bit jittery for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>After lunch it was time for Aaron.  His presentation had both a healthy serving of comedic relief as well as filling geekery.  Who else but Aaron would code a way, using a webcam, to scan all of his Magic the Gathering cards and catalog their value?  Oh and did I mention there were cats?  Aaron urged the audience to help him test out one of his projects related to OpenCV.  We were to all send him a tweet with the words &ldquo;Photo Me&rdquo;.  The goal was for his program to see the tweet, take a picture of Aaron at that moment in time, and send the picture to the person who tweeted him.  Well it seems one variable wasn&rsquo;t accounted for &ndash; Twitter.  With a flood of incoming requests to his Twitter account, the &ldquo;enforcers&rdquo; locked his account.</p>

<p>Something that I had forgotten to mention earlier was that for most of the conference, Ben sat with me.  I really thought this was cool.  Most of the speakers sat together up front or to the side.  But I got to sit with Ben &ndash; just me and him.</p>

<p>Which brings me to one of Ben&rsquo;s friends &ndash; Konstantin.  Ben had made some reference to Konstantin in his presentation &ndash; well more like to Konstantin&rsquo;s bag which apparently got lost while enroute to a conference in the Philippines.  Konstantin had a good bit of humor in his presentation which focused on security.  It was very englightening to learn about the many different ways hackers try to compromise web applications, including Rails applications.  Both the Ruby and Rails teams make a great effort to eliminate/prevent security issues.  I&rsquo;ll admit there were parts of the talk that went over my head.  But overall, I found it very usefull and an area where I want to learn more.</p>

<p>Near the end of Konstantin&rsquo;s talk I started to feel the effect of not eating a proper lunch, and an overload of sweets.  I started getting a little light-headed.  So the end of the conference was a bit of a blur.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been to two Ruby related conferences &ndash; Ruby Conf 2013 in Miami, and now this one, Ancient City Ruby Conf 2014.  Although the one if Miami was much larger, I enjoyed the Ancient City one more.  I felt like I learned more at ACR and fit in better.  At the conference in Miami I very much felt like an outsider.  But at ACR I met a lot of people from all over the US and the world.  I am looking forward to another Ancient City Ruby conference in 2015!</p>
