  <div class="entry-content"><p>The dedicated and faithful reader of this old guy, would have noticed an extended
silence in this corner of the web.  I have, as the automated voice message of my
sons school would say, &ldquo;an unexcused absence.&rdquo;  While I won&rsquo;t make any excuses, I
would like to share what has kept me away from my writing.</p>

<p>Back in March I started to learn Swift by attending the Udacity iOS online program.
Udacity has partnered with the company I work at.  After successful completion of
the course, my company will reimburse me for the tuition.  About two weeks into
my training, the family and I went on a cruise.  Though I brought my laptop and
study material, I didn&rsquo;t spend much time Swift.</p>

<p>After our trip, and a hop-skip-jump over a week, it was time for Ancient City Ruby.
I enjoyed this years ACR conference, though I would have preferred a bit more
technical meat and less of the social fluffy stuff.  However, the most significant
part of ACR for me was meeting with another Ruby developer and getting accepted to
work part-time on a neat project.</p>

<p>The part-time project is my first &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; Ruby app that I&rsquo;ve been a part of.
Though I&rsquo;ve worked on some training apps or personal Rails apps, they have all been
small in scale compared to this new gig.  Being new to the project, and not knowing
much outside my experience with smaller apps, I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time
looking around and trying to get familiar with the applications structure.</p>

<p>And then came Rails Conference!  This year the conference was held in Atlanta, GA
which is not too bad a drive from Jacksonville, FL.  I hadn&rsquo;t yet been to a Rails
Conference, so of course I had to go.  Overall I enjoyed the time in Atlanta.  I
ran into a guy, David, who I had meet in Miami at Ruby Conf 2013.  Also, I got to
spend time with another developer that is working on the same project that I mentioned
above.</p>

<p>After the conference, I have been spending most of my evenings working on the
part-time project.  There is a lot to learn, but I am enjoying every minute of it.
The best part of my day is seeing my tests go green and being able to merge and
push my changes.</p>

<p>And that is my excuse, uh I mean my reasons, for not being active here for a while.
I had set a personal goal to publish a new post each month, and I&rsquo;m working to
raise the bar and publish twice a month.  Keep me honest &ndash; smack me via Twitter
if you feel I&rsquo;m slacking.  :)</p>

<p>Ok, now I&rsquo;d like to share a little snippet of code that illustrates something neat
I have learned while working on the part-time gig.  A great benefit of working on
a project with a mentor.  The first example is my original code before refactoring
to make it better and look a lot more &lsquo;Ruby-ish&rsquo;.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>  return nil
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And now the reveal &ndash; the pretty version which accomplishes the same thing.  Note
that during the refactor we re-named a few things, but the overall result was the
same.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While working on the Flex Blogger project, and studying the Bourbon website, in particular the <a href="http://refills.bourbon.io/">refills</a> side of the house, I liked the way their navigation bar looked.  In particular, I wanted to implement the search box feature.</p>

<p>So I grabbed their sample code and added it to the Flex Blogger project.  At first, I just brought over the raw html and eventually broke the code up into partials.  To keep things simple, I will focus on the syntax directly related to the search function, as seen below:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  &lt;div class="navigation-tools"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;div class="search-bar"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>        &lt;form role="search"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>          &lt;input type="search" placeholder="Enter Search" /&gt;
</span><span class='line'>          &lt;button type="submit"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>            &lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/refills/master/source/images/search-icon.png" alt="Search Icon"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>          &lt;/button&gt;
</span><span class='line'>        &lt;/form&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" class="sign-up"&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the Flex Blogger project, as with most of the Rails projects I have worked on, I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form">simple form</a>.  I use simple form simply because it was used in all the tutorials and learning material that I have digested.  So my mind focuses on simple form and I try to address any scenario that needs a form, by using <em>Simple Form</em>.</p>

<p>To help me work through my nav-bar search code, I refereneced some existing code in the Flex project, the category form partial:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>// _form.html.erb
</span><span class='line'>&lt;div id="category-form"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;%= simple_form_for(@category) do |f| %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;%= f.error_notification %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;div class="form-inputs"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;%= f.input :description %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;div class="form-actions"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;%= f.button :submit %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;% end %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;br&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I struggled a bit trying to get the search in the nav bar to work with Simple Form.  After trying different things I reached out to a buddy, Shaun, who has helped me in the past.  We paired for a bit and after listening to what I was trying to do, and what I had tried, he asked me a <em>simple</em> question: &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you using a form_tag?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huh?  I thought that because I was using Simple Form that I needed to work within the boundaries of it.  I didn&rsquo;t realize that I could mix things when needed.  So off we went to the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/">rails api</a> and searched for &lsquo;form_tag&rsquo;.</p>

<p>You should be able to find form_tag under the ActionView::Helpers::FormTagHelper section.  From the documentation:</p>

<h4>form_tag(url_for_options = {}, options = {}, &amp;block) <BR></h4>

<blockquote><p>Starts a form tag that points the action to an url configured with url_for_options just like ActionController::Base#url_for. The method for the form defaults to POST.</p></blockquote>

<p>After the lesson, and referring to the api docs, the solution we used was as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>// _search_bar.html.erb
</span><span class='line'>&lt;div class="navigation-tools"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;div class="search-bar"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;%= form_tag("/search") do %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;%= text_field_tag :query, nil, placeholder: "Enter Search", type: "search" %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;%= button_tag type: "submit", id: "search-query" do %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>        &lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/refills/master/source/images/search-icon.png", alt: "Search Icon" &gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;% end %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;% end %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I am <em>simply</em> amazed at how there is something new to learn just about everyday.  Just when I thought I was really comfortable with working things out with Rails/Ruby, I come across an opportunity to expand my ole grey matter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two weeks ago from today, at about this time I was kicked back in the main show room of the <strong>ms Nieuw Amsterdam</strong> waiting for the opening act to begin.  With a full stomach from an awesome meal, and a refreshing drink in hand, I was in full relax mode.  The last thing I was thinking about was code.</p>

<p>When I woke up, Monday morning, I had an itching to crack open the laptop and work on some things I had left hanging from two days prior.  But first, a quick stop for breakfast, then I headed to the ships library.  I was knocking out tasks one by one, committing away locally on my laptop.  Then instinctively, my muscle memory kicked in and before I could catch what I was doing, I typed:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git push origin master</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Duh!  You are on a ship, in the Caribbean, without a connection to the net.  No big deal, I can push my stuff to github when I return home.</p>

<p>I continued working on different things until I found myself stuck &ndash; I needed to refer to the api docs or some type of reference.  I was on vacation &ndash; the smart thing to do would have been to shut down my laptop and go relax.  Can you guess what I did?</p>

<p>Perhaps the thick-headed Irish blood in me, I decided to find a solution.  After a little digging, I found some gold nuggets in the following path:  ~/.gem/ruby/2.1.5/gems/rails-4.1.7/guides/source/</p>

<p>Reviewing some of the files in the above directory, I was able to get an answer for what I was looking for.  Saved my work, closed the laptop and headed to the gangway to catch a tender to a beautiful private island.</p>

<p>Later that day, while chatting with my dad, he let me know that he purchased a block of 200 minutes of internet time.  Satellite internet is not very fast, but good enough for quick browsing or checking of email.</p>

<p>I knew that I&rsquo;d be cracking open the laptop from time-to-time, and working on Flex Blogger as well as an app for my day job.  But I didn&rsquo;t want to burn through those sacred internet minutes when I needed to review either the Ruby or Rails APIs.  Surely there had to be a better way.  Of course there is, and I found the following site:</p>

<p><a href="https://rubydocs.org/">https://rubydocs.org/</a></p>

<p>One can visit the above site and download a local copy of the Ruby and/or Rails APIs.  The neat thing is, you can choose which version or Ruby or Rails that you want to download the documentation for.  Neat!</p>

<p>With a local copy of the documentation I was needing, I pushed my committed changes from the previous day, then logged out &ndash; only used about 15 minutes of our satellite internet.  :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my previous <a href="http://oldguynewtrick.com/blog/2015/02/03/gathering-of-some-newbs/">post</a> I spoke about the Flex Blogger project.  Josh introduced us to a new component called ckeditor.  Ckeditor is a javascript based gui text editor.  After using ckeditor I thought it would be beneficial to add it to another application I created for my day job &ndash; HarePD.</p>

<p>Before starting on new features, I will fire off my test suite to make sure everything is still green.  For me I just type:  rspec</p>

<p>I love seeing all that green!  Next, I created a branch to work on this new feature, and updated my Gemfile:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git checkout -b add_ckeditor
</span><span class='line'>vim Gemfile
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>{added}
</span><span class='line'>gem 'ckeditor'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can get more information regarding how to setup ckeditor in your rails application by visiting <a href="https://github.com/galetahub/ckeditor">here</a></p>

<p>With the new gem added, and minor updates made in the appropriate view file, _form.html.slim, it was time to re-run my test suite.  Things were looking good as I saw green, green, green.  Then, as my tests executed on the scenarios that used ckeditor, I started to see red.  No big deal I thought, probably a simple change.  Below is an example of one of my tests that was failing:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>spec/support/issues_helper.rb
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>def create_issue
</span><span class='line'>  click_link 'Add Issue'
</span><span class='line'>  fill_in 'Title', with: 'Cert Expiration'
</span><span class='line'>  fill_in 'Description', with: 'SSL Cert Expiration'
</span><span class='line'>  select('2', :from =&gt; 'User level')
</span><span class='line'>  select('Linux', :from =&gt; 'Os')
</span><span class='line'>  click_button 'Submit'
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Ok, this should be an easy fix.  I inspected the ckeditor element on my webpage using the Chrome Dev Tools, and got the new name &ndash; issue_description.  So I updated the tests that were using &lsquo;Description&rsquo; and replaced with &lsquo;issue_description.&rsquo;  I ran a focused test, on just one scenario and it went green.  Next, I ran all the tests in that particular spec file and again I had a combination of green and red.  Argh!  I took notice of all the failed tests and ran them each one-by-one.  They all passed &ndash; they were all green when executed on their own.  Argh f#@% damnit!</p>

<p>Many hours passed as well as changes here and there to try and get things working.  To keep this post fairly short, I&rsquo;m going to jump to the solution.  After some research and trying different solutions, I stumbled upon the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>With the above in place, I refactored my create_issue method from above to read as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>  click_button 'Submit'
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After making the above changes, I ran my tests for the single spec file and to my delight, everything was green.  Now the real moment of truth &ndash; run the entire test suite.  A smile slowly expanded on my face as all the green scrolled by without a single pixel of red!</p>

<p>Although this issue aggravated me for a bit, the end result was much happiness and joy.  Not to mention I learned a few cool new things here and there in the process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks back I was discussing an idea around the weekly Code and Coffee table.
The idea was a spin on something I saw Nathan Barry discussing over <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/24hours/">here</a>.
I still consider myself a newbie to Ruby, but I wanted to do my own personal hack-a-thon.</p>

<p>Well that idea morphed, or is the cool thing to say, pivoted, to a project that me
and two other new to Ruby programmers would work on. All three of us discussed the
idea of creating something new.  Something no one else has done before.  A blog
written in Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Hopefully now you are not looking at your screen with coffee sprayed all over it
due to your laughing.  I know, there have been many, many Blog type projects.  So
why is this one different?  I&rsquo;m not sure it really is.  What I can say is that
project is giving us an opportunity to work together and learn from each other.
Not to say anything bad about you seniors out there, but there are times I feel
that the best way to illustrate that I&rsquo;ve learned something that you have passed
on, is to share that knowledge with others around my level.</p>

<p>So yes, we are making a dynamic blog written in Rails.  If you are interested in
checking it out, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/hogihung/flex_blogger">here</a>.
Please keep in mind that we are still in active development.  I will update the
README file once we are at a point where we think the application is solid.</p>

<p>There are a lot of &lsquo;firsts&rsquo; for me in regards to this project.  This is the first
web application I&rsquo;m working on with more than two people actively working at the
same time.  I&rsquo;m learning how to create and manage pull requests.  I&rsquo;m attempting
to help lead the project and keep all of us updated on the progress.</p>

<p>All three of us have been working with Ruby and Rails for a little bit &ndash; perhaps
a year or year and half.  But there are some other &lsquo;new to us&rsquo; components that we
have choosen to try out.  We decided to bypass Devise and Twitter Bootstrap &ndash; both
things that were comfortable to us.  Instead, we are using several great tools
that <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/">Thoughtbot</a> has shared with the community
including:  Bourbon, Neat, Bitters, Refills, Clearance, FactoryGirl and HoundCI.</p>

<p>I welcome any feedback on our project, <strong>Flex Blogger</strong>.  Just shoot me a tweet on
Twitter, or email me.  I&rsquo;m excited to see the final product and have this cool
experience.</p>

<p>I still want to test my skills by doing a personal hack-a-thon, but I need to
convince some of the gurus I know to be my guest drop ins.  :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been troubleshooting an issue with my pet project.  On my laptop, in a development environment, I didn&rsquo;t seem to have any issues. My test suite has been working fine, but when I deployed the app to a production environment, I started to discover some issues.  Issues that revolve around the database.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a SQL guru, so from time-to-time when I want to poke around my Postgres database, I use an application called PGAdmin.  So I fired up PGAdmin and tried to connect to the Postgres database that is running on my server, over the internet.  Politely, PGAdmin told me to go pound sand &ndash; it was not able to connect.  After a little research I learned that there were two files on my server, related to postgres, that I needed to update.</p>

<p>On your remote server, that has Postgres running, modify the two files indicated below:<br>
<em>(Note: your path might be different depending on your version of Postgres and your Linux distro)</em></p>

<pre>
sudo vim /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf  
# Added by jfhogarty to support remote access and PGAdmin
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5


sudo vim /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql.conf 
#The next line added by jfhogarty to enable remote access and PGAdmin
listen_addresses = '*'

</pre>


<p>Lastly, with the above changes added to the two .conf files, we need to restart Posgtres:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo service postgresql restart</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With the above changes in place, and postgres restarted, I fired up PGAdmin again on my laptop.  And like <em>butter</em> I was able to connect to and work with my databases. I resumed debugging my original issue.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I created my Digital Ocean VPS I setup SSH Keys for both my main laptop and desktop computers.  I grabbed the appropriate contents from my .pub file and pasted that information on the web form for &lsquo;Add SSH Key&rsquo; under the SSH Keys menu of my droplet.  However, I noticed that each time I would ssh to my server I would be required to input my password.</p>

<p>In this blog posting I will illustrate how I solved this issue and why the word &lsquo;custom&rsquo; appears in the title.  There are many websites that cover how to setup passwordless ssh login.  For example, Digital Ocean has a nice posting: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2">here</a></p>

<p>However, those instructions, and other like it, assume a plain-vanilla setup.  Of course, I dare to be different.  For example, before I started to solve this puzzle, my ~/.ssh directory had the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>➜  .ssh  ls -la
</span><span class='line'>total 88
</span><span class='line'>drwx------  11 jfhogarty  staff   374 Jan  6 18:36 .
</span><span class='line'>drwxr-xr-x+ 93 jfhogarty  staff  3162 Jan  6 20:10 ..
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--@  1 jfhogarty  staff  6148 Mar  9  2013 .DS_Store
</span><span class='line'>-rw-------   1 jfhogarty  staff  1766 Mar  2  2013 id_rsa
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff   400 Mar  2  2013 id_rsa.pub
</span><span class='line'>-rw-------   1 jfhogarty  staff   668 Apr 20  2014 jh-mbp_id
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff   614 Apr 20  2014 jh-mbp_id.pub
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff  7162 Jan  5 21:17 known_hosts
</span><span class='line'>➜  .ssh</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The id_rsa (private file) and the id_rsa.pub (public file,) are your normal files one would find.  But I&rsquo;ve implemented a &lsquo;best-practice&rsquo; adopted from my day job and I create specific key files for different types of access.  For example, following the instructions in the link above, from the Digital Ocean article, I created the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>-rw-------   1 jfhogarty  staff   668 Jan  5 21:11 do_id_dsa
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff   614 Jan  5 21:11 do_id_dsa.pub</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you follow the steps from the link, there is one thing that you may need to do in addition to their steps.  Some systems require that you change the file permissions for the authorized_keys file located on your target computer.  For example, the following is how I have the permissions set on my VPS:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>➜  .ssh  ls -la
</span><span class='line'>total 12
</span><span class='line'>drwx------  2 jfhogarty jfhogarty 4096 Jan  5 21:16 .
</span><span class='line'>drwxr-xr-x 11 jfhogarty jfhogarty 4096 Jan  6 20:14 ..
</span><span class='line'>-rw-------  1 jfhogarty jfhogarty  614 Jan  5 21:14 authorized_keys
</span><span class='line'>➜  .ssh</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I adjusted the permissions using the following syntax:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>chmod 600 authorized_keys</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After creating the new keys on my laptop, and updating the authorized_keys file on the remote server, I thought surely I should now be able to login without using a password.  I was wrong!  The remote server continued to prompt me for my password.  I decided to call it a night as it was getting late.</p>

<p>While working on a VM issue today for my day job, my internal lightbulb went off and I realized what the problem was.  Lets take a fresh look at the .ssh directory of my laptop:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sh  ls -la
</span><span class='line'>total 88
</span><span class='line'>drwx------  11 jfhogarty  staff   374 Jan  6 18:36 .
</span><span class='line'>drwxr-xr-x+ 93 jfhogarty  staff  3162 Jan  6 20:21 ..
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--@  1 jfhogarty  staff  6148 Mar  9  2013 .DS_Store
</span><span class='line'>-rw-------   1 jfhogarty  staff   668 Jan  5 21:11 do_id_dsa
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff   614 Jan  5 21:11 do_id_dsa.pub
</span><span class='line'>-rw-------   1 jfhogarty  staff  1766 Mar  2  2013 id_rsa
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff   400 Mar  2  2013 id_rsa.pub
</span><span class='line'>-rw-------   1 jfhogarty  staff   668 Apr 20  2014 jh-mbp_id
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff   614 Apr 20  2014 jh-mbp_id.pub
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--   1 jfhogarty  staff  7162 Jan  5 21:17 known_hosts
</span><span class='line'>➜  .ssh</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The keen eye might notice that I now have three sets of private/public keys.  However, when I was typing ssh myhostname.com ssh didn&rsquo;t know which files to use, if any.  I was able to prove my theory by trying the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ssh -p 9986 -i ~/.ssh/do_id_dsa myhostname.com</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And BAM!  No password required to login.  I was on to a solution.  When I had my lightbulb moment, I had remembered that I needed to create a config file in the .ssh directory on my laptop.  Lets take a look at it:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>➜  .ssh  cat config
</span><span class='line'>Host 10.11.12.13
</span><span class='line'>IdentityFile ~/.ssh/do_id_dsa
</span><span class='line'>Protocol 2
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Host myhostname.com
</span><span class='line'>IdentityFile ~/.ssh/do_id_dsa
</span><span class='line'>Protocol 2
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>➜  .ssh</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>NOTE:  To protect the innocent, the IP Address and *.com name above are fake.  Please substitute those values for your real IP Address and/or domain name.</p>

<p>And that is how I solved my customized passwordless ssh access to my VPS.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been making progress with a personal application that I am working on.  In the early days of development, I had deployed a version of the application to Heroku &ndash; and it worked fine at that time.  Fast forward 6 months or so and lots of changes.  I deployed to Heroku and received an error when trying to view the website:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>heroku logs

<p>That error made no sense to me.  What the heck, I know the favicon.ico file exists, and why can&rsquo;t I get to the root path?  So I went to the rails console via heroku:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>heroku run rails console
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Running `rails console` attached to terminal... up, run.9397

<p>Note that I am substituting my real class name with a bogus one, &lsquo;Nurny&rsquo;, for this example.</p>

<p>Ok, now I get an error that looks like a real error, though I didn&rsquo;t understand it.  Luckily this all occurred the night before our weekly morning Code and Coffee.  So I brought the issue up and Micah gave me a hand for a while, having me try different things.</p>

<p>The conflict only shows when trying to run in a production environment.  I had a model for &lsquo;Nurny&rsquo; that had a class defined of Nurny.  However, I also have a model concern, for queries, with a class of &lsquo;Nurny&rsquo; which was the cause of the issue.</p>

<p>So, now how can I fix this?  I tried a simple rename of the concern, changing the line:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>BEFORE
</span><span class='line'>class Nurny
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>AFTER
</span><span class='line'>class NurnyQry</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But that spurred a flurry of new problems.  Luckily I found another solution while thinking through this issue.  Why did the app work fine in a development rails environment, but not in production.  Now I must confess I&rsquo;m not sure if my solution will have a profound negative effect, but so far I have not encountered any issues.  The solution lies in the config/environments/production.rb file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>BEFORE:
</span><span class='line'>config.eager_load = true
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>AFTER:
</span><span class='line'>config.eager_load = false</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And that simple configuration change fixed my issue!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When meeting new people in the programming community, we frequently share what we do in our day jobs.  By day I primarily use Perl, though I have been slowly building up an arsenal of Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications.  But before learning Matz&rsquo;s Ruby, I learned a different flavor of Ruby.  And this &lsquo;aint your ruby.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When I first transitioned to the team I am on now, my primary duties were to provide tier three support of specialized networking equipment.  Our team can be split into two roles:  Tech Support/Project Management and Automation/Programming.  Over time, I migrated over to the Automation side. We use Perl for our tool server scripts and Ruby to get things started.  Off to the internet I went to learn Ruby, only to quickly find that our Ruby was not the Ruby I found online.</p>

<p>The Ruby we use at work stands for:  <strong>R</strong>ules yo<strong>U B</strong>uild <strong>Y</strong>ourself.  I believe the foundation or underlaying language is Java.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, our networking equipment sends events/traps to a trap collector.  That collector then does some processing on the event and forwards to our Ruby system.  We then perform certain actions using our Ruby based on the received alarms/events.  Below is a small example of code of &lsquo;our&rsquo; Ruby:</p>

<p>Pretty wild stuff, eh?  This is just a short snippet &ndash; there is a lot more going on in our &lsquo;library&rsquo; of packets and rules.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I got a bug, ney rather an itch I needed to scratch.  I have been using RVM for over a year and half.  I have had some issues, but mostly those were due to me learning how to work with RVM.</p>

<p>I was having an odd issue on one of my Macs so I decided to remove RVM and install rbenv.  I shot a tweet out to see if anyone had an opinion about rbenv and I received a reply suggesting I give chruby a chance.  Recently I had listened to an episode of Ruby Rogues <a href="http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/169-rr-version-managers-with-michal-papis-mislav-maronic-and-postmodern-mod-iii">#169</a>,  where they talked about RVM, rbenv, and chruby.</p>

<p>So I decied to give chruby a try.  Removing RVM is pretty straight forward.  You should be able to simply run:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rvm implode</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once removed, you may need to edit your .bashrc/.zshrc or *profile file(s) to remove any reference to RVM.</p>

<p>While I really like RVM, I&rsquo;ve always been a bit worried about the magic it performs &ndash; the stuff it does for me that I&rsquo;m not familiar with.  Chruby seemed to be easier for me to grasp.  From my limited understanding, there seems to be less moving parts in chruby vs. RVM.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to lay out all of the steps to get chruby installed.  The source web pages for chruby and ruby-install are very easy to read and comprehend.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby">chruby</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install">ruby-install</a></p>

<p>It took me a little bit to understand the differences of chruby and how I would use in my environment.  But after getting it running on my laptop, I converted two other Macs, my Ubuntu VM, and my CentOS server to use chruby.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, I do like RVM, and it had served me well.  I still use RVM at my day job on our CentOS servers.  I thought changing from RVM to chruby on those servers would be a good idea, so I attempted to change a development server.  While the removal of RVM and install of Chruby went fine, I ran into a huge issue.  I could not get Passenger to work properly under Chruby.  I&rsquo;m sure the reason is due to my lack of understanding, but I just couldn&rsquo;t afford to figure it out. So I switched back to RVM &ndash; and RVM will stay on our work servers.</p>
