  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I&rsquo;d to visit vims&#8217; cousing, MacVim.  While I do spend most of my time in what I will call &ldquo;normal&rdquo; vim, that is vim executed from the command line of my terminal (iTerm), there are times when I want to work in MacVim.  I tend to reserve MacVim to acts as my general use notepad.  The main reason I treat it as a scratch/notepad instead of vim, is that I find copying and pasting to be more user friendly with MacVim.  There are some other aspects I like, for example being able to scroll using the trackpad on my laptop or via the scroll wheel on a mouse.</p>

<p>While watching some episodes of Elixir Sips and LearnElixir I noticed that the presenters had a pretty cool setup in vim.  I did a little research and found that they use a plugin similar to Airline.  The plugin, and ones similar to it, dress up your vim environment.  So I installed one of the plugins, <em>bling/vim-airline</em> and ran into issues with the display &ndash; it was a little bit off.  Through more research, I discovered that I needed to install the Powerline family of fonts.  Once that was completed my vim environment looked awesome.</p>

<p>However, when I launched MacVim, I was having issues.  Back to the web and more reading.  I found that I needed to update my gvimrc file to setup the use of a guifont. Initially I tried updating the gvimrc and set the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>set guifont=Source\ Code\ Pro\ Powerline:14</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I tried a few different combinations, with out success.  So I decided to play around a bit.  First I launched MacVim (mvim).  Then I tried to manually set the font using:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>:set guifont=SourceCodeProforPowerline -&gt; didn't work
</span><span class='line'>:set guifont=Source\ Code\ Pro\ for\ Powerline:14  -&gt; didn't work</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I stumbled upon a answer over at StackOverflow and noticed that the poster included an &lsquo;h&rsquo; just before the font size.  So I gave that a try:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>:set guifont=Source\ Code\ Pro\ for\ Powerline:h14  -&gt; WORKED!</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Cool, I got that to work.  But dang, I don&rsquo;t want to have to type that everytime I launch MacVim and want my environment to be all gooey-fied.  So I decided to make a modification to my .vimrc file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>" set a guifont for MacVim and Powerline Font support
</span><span class='line'>" You can now use Cntrl+g to turn on the font setting below
</span><span class='line'>nnoremap &lt;C-g&gt; :set guifont=Source\ Code\ Pro\ for\ Powerline:h14&lt;cr&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Tip: You can also use this format:
</span><span class='line'>set guifont=Source_Code_Pro_for_Powerline:h14 </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>While I like, and use the Cntrl+g option as indicated above, my stubbornish really wanted to get the font working via an update to the gvimrc file.  Once I saw, through my trial and errors above, what MacVim was looking for in the ways of proper syntax, I re-visited updating the gvimrc file.  So I added the following to my gvimrc file and restarted MacVim:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>set guifont=Source_Code_Pro_for_Powerline:h14 </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And BAM! my nice gooey font setting was applied.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I would like to share a productivity tip that I learned from my pair/lead developer partner.  Vim continues to surprise me on what seems to be a daily basis.  I know that with my neophyte knowledge with vim, that I&rsquo;m barely scratching the surface.  Ok, let&rsquo;s get down with some Macro Econom&hellip;, I mean VimOnomics.</p>

<p>Recently I was tasked with changing a handful of our fixture *.csv files.  In case you have not yet worked with these types of files, they are a simple text file which use a delimiter, commonly the comma.  For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>phone_prefix,phone_num,city,state,postal_code
</span><span class='line'>914,2251976,Carmel,New York,10134</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now imagine a file in the above format, but with hundreds of rows and that we need to change the phone_prefix from 914 to 944.  Also, imagine that we have a dozen or so fixture files that require this update.  Using the power of macros in vim, this can be a relatively easy task.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[Open all of our fixture files]
</span><span class='line'>vim spec/fixtures/*/*.csv
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>[Record the macro]
</span><span class='line'>qq
</span><span class='line'>:1,$s/^914,/944,/
</span><span class='line'>:w
</span><span class='line'>:n
</span><span class='line'>q</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To review what the above steps are doing, first we tell vim to start recording using the command qq.  Next, we define our replace command telling vim that we want to replace 914, with 944, and then we write the file using :w to save our changes.  The :n command tells vim to move to the next file and q stops the recording.</p>

<p>With the macro ready to go, we can use @q to launch the macro.  This should bring the next file in the buffer into focus and perform the steps outlined in the macro.  Repeat the @q command until all of your files have been updated.  After feeling the pain of doing manual updates for a while, this tip was much welcomed.</p>

<p>However, we are are not done yet.  We need to address this change of 914 to 944 in our related feature file(s).  Continuing onwards with our example, we will assume that we have an existing feature file with some steps similar to the following (picture dozens if not hundreds of lines):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  And   I download the csv file report "Phone-Records" as admin
</span><span class='line'>  Then  the contents of the downloaded "Phone-Records" report contain:

<p>For our example, assume we have our new data in the file new_phone_prefix.csv:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>phone_prefix,phone_num,city,state,postal_code
</span><span class='line'>944,2251976,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2251981,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2251376,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2252946,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2253976,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2251376,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2254576,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2258986,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2259176,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2257326,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2251974,Carmel,New York,10134</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And we want to replace our data with new data, or perhaps we are creating the feature steps from scratch.  For our first step, let&rsquo;s create/edit our feature file to have the basics:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  And   I download the csv file report "Phone-Records" as admin
</span><span class='line'>  Then  the contents of the downloaded "Phone-Records" report contain:
</span><span class='line'>    | text                                          |
</span><span class='line'>    | phone_prefix,phone_num,city,state,postal_code |</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, we will yank (y) the new data from the new_phone_prefix.csv file and place (p) them under what we just did:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  And   I download the csv file report "Phone-Records" as admin
</span><span class='line'>  Then  the contents of the downloaded "Phone-Records" report contain:
</span><span class='line'>    | text                                          |
</span><span class='line'>    | phone_prefix,phone_num,city,state,postal_code |
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>944,2251976,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2251981,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2251376,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2252946,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2253976,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2251376,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2254576,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2258986,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2259176,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2257326,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>944,2251974,Carmel,New York,10134</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we need to move the data to line up with the left hand pipe (|) character.  I will place my cursor over the 9 on the first row of data, then use Cntrl+v to visual select a column, and press j until I have all the records covered.  Then I&rsquo;ll use shift+i to insert and press my space bar 4 times then the | key.  Lastly, remove that line break between our column headers and the data.  You should have something similar to:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  And   I download the csv file report "Phone-Records" as admin
</span><span class='line'>  Then  the contents of the downloaded "Phone-Records" report contain:
</span><span class='line'>    | text                                          |
</span><span class='line'>    | phone_prefix,phone_num,city,state,postal_code |
</span><span class='line'>    |944,2251976,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>    |944,2251981,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>    |944,2251376,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>    |944,2252946,Carmel,New York,10134
</span><span class='line'>    |944,2253976,Carmel,New York,10134

</span><span class='line'>    |944,2251974,Carmel,New York,10134</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Hang in there, we are almost done.  To wrap this up, we return to using a macro.  I will position my cursor on the first line of data, build a macro, then execute it as follow:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>esc
</span><span class='line'>j
</span><span class='line'>q
</span><span class='line'>10 @q</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Assuming you were successful, we should have something similar to:</p>

<p>The clever eye may have noticed that we executed our macro in a slightly different manner this time &ndash; 10 @q.  After recording the macro for our first row of data, we tell vim to execute the macro ten times by using:  10 @q.</p>

<p>I use this second example, of editting a feature file, more frequently that the first example.  After updating the feature files manually for too many times that I&rsquo;d like to admit to, I finally asked my pair if he knew a better way.  Of course he did, what a silly question.  He showed me the above techniques which saves me a lot of cycles &ndash; time which can be better spent on actual code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although at times I feel like taking a hammer and some nails to bang some sense into my code, what I actually will be discussing today is related to a feature I was working on that required some updates to our Ruby/Rails code and JavaScript.  I typically find myself using pry to help me work through issues with the ruby code.  But for this feature, I needed to grab my hammer, make that Chromes&#8217; Developer tools, to assist in my debugging.</p>

<p>A little background first &ndash; assume we have a view that has a form on it.  A new requirement has been requested for us to add an upload file feature to that same view.  No problem, I can use form_tag to accomplish this task.  After making some changes, I was able to confirm that the view in question displayed the original form with a submit button, and a form to handle choosing a file to upload and its&#8217; corresponding upload button.  Below is an example of the first form_tag, and the second new form_tag:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ORIGINAL
</span><span class='line'>  = form_tag({action: 'update'}, id: "original-form") do
</span><span class='line'>    = button_tag 'Submit', id: 'confirm-button', type: 'button', disabled: @nurny.disable_submit_button?
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>ADDITIONAL
</span><span class='line'>  = form_tag({action: :upload}, multipart: :true, id: "upload-file") do
</span><span class='line'>    = file_field_tag 'upload_file'
</span><span class='line'>    = button_tag 'Upload', id: "upload-button", class: "good", type: 'button', disabled: false</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Something to keep in mind, when you have multiple forms on the same page, is to be sure you have a way to uniquely identify each form.  With the code updated, I went to test the forms.  To my surprise, when clicking either the Submit button or the Update button, nothing seemed to happen.  For the submit button, I could see Rails going through the motions of hitting the controller and associated update action, but the page didn&rsquo;t refresh with the data as I was expecting.</p>

<p>Well, this would be interesting.  I couldn&rsquo;t pry my way into seeing what was happening.  So I viewed my problem page in Chrome and pulled up the Developer Tools.  After a little digging, and cursing, I saw that my new form, &lsquo;upload-file&rsquo;, was nested under the original form.  This was causing my issue with neither form being able to properly set their data.  What makes this new request a bit of a challenge is that we are building a view by using partials.  So I didn&rsquo;t initially catch that I was nesting my new form inside the original one.</p>

<p>How did I notice the new form was nested?  Using the Developer Tools, View Source, I observed something like the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>I snipped out all of the surrounding HTML so we can focus on the problem &ndash; my new form, &lsquo;upload-file&rsquo;, was nested inside the &lsquo;original&rsquo; form.</p>

<p>NOTE: You may notice that I take the liberty to substitute actual syntax with filler syntax &ndash; just look for the all capitalized words.  I also like to use nurny and bobots as a substitute when needed.</p>

<p>With the nested forms issue resolved, my original form was now working. But my second form still had an issue. I could click on the Choose File button, select and file, and then click on the Upload button.  However, nothing happened.  At this point I need to grab my cup of JavaScript.</p>

<p>For my initial attack, let&rsquo;s write just enough javascript to get things working &ndash; no validation:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>app/assets/javascript/nurny/validation.js
</span><span class='line'>function uploadFile() {
</span><span class='line'>  $('#upload-button').click(function() {
</span><span class='line'>    var $form = $('#upload-file');
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    $form.submit();
</span><span class='line'>    return true;
</span><span class='line'>  });
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>app/assets/javascript/nurny/bobots.js
</span><span class='line'>$(document).ready(function() {
</span><span class='line'>  nurnyBobotter();
</span><span class='line'>  setUnsubmit();
</span><span class='line'>  uploadFile();
</span><span class='line'>)};</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With the above code in place, I was successful in choosing a file to upload, and by clicking the upload button, getting my data processed as planned.  In my ruby code I am validating that the user actually choose a file, else I present an error.  However, we would like to catch the &lsquo;no file chosen&rsquo; issue before being processed by our controller.  Yup, you guessed it &ndash; we need some more javascript.</p>

<p>I updated my previously created function, uploadFile() with the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>app/assets/javascript/nurny/validation.js
</span><span class='line'>function uploadFile() {
</span><span class='line'>  $('#upload-button').click(function() {
</span><span class='line'>    var $form = $('#upload-file');
</span><span class='line'>    var $uploadedFiles = $('#upload_file');
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    if ($uploadedFiles.length &lt;= 0) {
</span><span class='line'>      displayFlashError("You have not chosen a file.");
</span><span class='line'>      return false;
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    $form.submit();
</span><span class='line'>    return true;
</span><span class='line'>  });
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To my surprise, nothing happened.  In fact, now my Upload File form wouldn&rsquo;t work at all.  Argh!  Back to Chrome and the Developer Tools.  Using the console feature, I tried out a few things to see what going on:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[no file chosen]

</span><span class='line'>$uploadedFiles.length
</span><span class='line'>1</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Hmmm, whether a file has been selected or not, I am getting a length of 1.  Obviously I&rsquo;m doing something wrong.  Off to the net to search for possible solutions.  I like to give credit to the following Stack Overflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/833012/how-to-validate-a-file-upload-field-using-javascript-jquery">entry</a></p>

<p>Using what I learned from the above link, and first testing it in Chromes&#8217; Developer Tools, I updated my code as illustrated below:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>This wraps up today&rsquo;s post, but hopefully you will find it useful.  I have spent a lot time recently, debugging using pry, that I had to dust off another very valuable tool in my tool box.  No, not my hammer, but the handy Developer Tools in Chrome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Order is important, sometimes.  Recently I was assigned a task passed on by QA.  In the application that I am working on,
users can download files from the &ldquo;Download&rdquo; section after they login.  Depending on their role, admin or client, the downloadable
file links will have slightly different names.</p>

<p>In an effort to keep things unified, QA felt that the order of those links is important &ndash; they need to match.  Prior to this
revelation, our tests only confirmed that the links existed, were clickable, and the contents of the files was accurate.  Below
is a sample of the new steps I created to get things going:</p>

<p>I struggled for a bit to figure out, how can I write my Cucumber steps so that I verify the data, in the exact order as
specified in the feature file.  My original steps above didn&rsquo;t have an order column.  But as I thought things through, I
added the order attribute as seen above.  Now what?  How do I build my steps so that they can actually confirm the order
of my rows in the download link table?  After some trial and errors, and many searches I put together the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Then /^I confirm the following downloadable files:$/ do |table|
</span><span class='line'>  table.hashes.each do |line|
</span><span class='line'>    within('tbody') do
</span><span class='line'>      row_num = "tr:nth-child(#{line[:order]})"
</span><span class='line'>      within(row_num) do
</span><span class='line'>        expect(page).to have_text line[:description]
</span><span class='line'>      end
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Pretty neat, eh?  With this method, you do not need to ensure that your steps in the feature file are in the exact desired
order.  Just be sure to have the correct value in the order column.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week I attended the school of Hard Knocks &ndash; a course in JavaScript. The application
that I am working on for the day job does validation in both JavaScript and in Ruby. One
of my recent tasks was to add form input text boxes, zero to many, so that an Administrator
could add URLs for resources available to the users.</p>

<p>These new input boxes would be included in an existing form, which is first validated using
JavaScript.  When I added the new input boxes, I received a flash message saying that my new
input box needed to have an integer value greater than zero. So I dug into the existing
JavaScript to see how the validation was setup.  What I found was that we had a switch with
several cases and a default which would display the error I received.  My new input boxes
for a url file path obviously do not need to be a non-zero integer.  So I updated the code
with something similar to:  case &lsquo;url_file_path&rsquo;.</p>

<p>This update worked fine so long as we only had one input box for url_file_path.  But the
requirement was that we provide zero to many input boxes based on a certain criteria.  My
thought was that I could use a regular expression within my Switch-Case code.  But I ran
into an issue.  Below is a simplified version of the existing code:</p>

<p>I utilized the JSBin site to help me work through possible solutions.  You can find
that site by clicking <a href="http://jsbin.com/">here</a></p>

<p>The above javascript worked fine, so long as had only one input for the file path url.<br/>
But we had the need to support zero to many url_file_path inputs.  For this discussion,
let&rsquo;s assume we have three:</p>

<ul>
<li>url_file_path_001</li>
<li>url_file_path_002</li>
<li>url_file_path_003</li>
</ul>


<p>Well now I have a problem with my javascript.  If you run the above example, passing in
url_file_path_00n as the simulated id, then the default alert of &lsquo;We hit the default&rsquo;
will occur.</p>

<p>What I needed was a way to use a regular expression with my case statement.  I struggled
with different attempts.  I thought I was going crazy.  I tried out my regular expression
logic on its own, and it worked fine. (Tip: RegEx web tool: <a href="https://regex101.com/#javascript">click here</a>)</p>

<p>I researched online for a solution, as well as referred to some JavaScripts book that I have,
but I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was going on.  While getting ready for bed, I came across an
item on Stack Overflow, one that I think I saw a few times but discarded.  Their example
kept referring to using switch (true)&hellip;  But I needed to switch on the id of the form input.</p>

<p>Then the light bulb went off in my head.  I made a mental note and got a good nights sleep.
The next day, I put the puzzle pieces together and came up with the following solution:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var id = 'url_file_path_002';  //simulated
</span><span class='line'>switch (true) {
</span><span class='line'>  case /file_title/.test(id):
</span><span class='line'>    alert('This is the file title'); 
</span><span class='line'>    break;
</span><span class='line'>  case /file_description/.test(id):
</span><span class='line'>    alert('This is the file description'); 
</span><span class='line'>    break;
</span><span class='line'>  case /url_file_path_(\d)+/.test(id):
</span><span class='line'>    alert('This is the file description');
</span><span class='line'>    break;
</span><span class='line'>  default:
</span><span class='line'>    alert('We hit the default');
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The above code could be tweaked a little bit since the validation for file_title
and file_description are the same.  Why don&rsquo;t you take a crack at it and let me
know how you would refactor?</p>

<p>Oh, I think I hear the bell &ndash; school is out for today!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been watching some shows lately that focus around World War I and II, thus the catchy title in todays&#8217; post.  I am now in week three of the new job as a full time Ruby developer, and I&rsquo;ve already learned a lot more than I was expecting.  Today I would like to share some little tidbits of knowledge I have accumulated.</p>

<p>Prior to accepting this new job I had been slowly learning how to use vim for more than a quick edit of a server config file.  But it wasn&rsquo;t until I was spending my entire day in vim, and pairing with others, that I realized how powerful vim is, and how little I know about it.  I was a Sublime Text user, and the switch to vim was a leap for me. I had a certain workflow down in Sublime and I needed to learn how to do the same types of things, and more, in vim.</p>

<p>One of my favorite aspects of Sublime was that it remembered all of the files I had open previously, so that when I restarted Sublime, all of my files would be re-opened in their respective tabs.  For about two weeks, I really missed that feature and finally decided, surely vim can do this.  Off to the net for a solution.  I was excited to find that not only could I save all of my open files and tabs, but I could do it with a twist.  Let me explain.</p>

<p>There are times where I am working on say two or three features/issues/bugs through out the span of a few days.  I will bounce between branches off our main app (master) and while working in each of those branches I need different files open.  Vim has a cool command, mksession, that will allow me handle this scenario.  For example, I am working on feature add_user_attribute in a branch with a similar name.  I have six or so files open to work on this item.  However, I need to go work on another task but I don&rsquo;t want to have to remember all of these files that I had open.  Prior to this new tip, what I was doing was executing the command :tabs and taking a screen capture of my open tabs and files.  But with this new knowledge, I now can do the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>:mksession ~/add_user_attribute.vim</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That will save my entire vim session &ndash; all open files and their respective tabs.  You can modify the file and path to your liking.  In my example above I am saving the file add_user_attribute.vim to my home directory.  With my session saved, I can now go work on some other tasks.  When I come back to this branch, and want to resume my work, I simply type the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>vim -S ~/add_user_attribute.vim</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Pretty neat, huh?  Sure beats taking a screen shot and re-opening the desired files each time.</p>

<p>To assist me in my learning of vim, I have a desktop/space dedicated to Vim research.  I&rsquo;m not sure if other operating systems have that feature, but I work on a Mac so I can swipe or Cntrl+right_arrow/left_arrow to work in another desktop/space.  In my vim research desktop I have Chrome fired up with tabs full of answers to all the common things I&rsquo;m trying to do with vim.  Those browser tabs stay there until my muscle memory has kicked in and I no longer need them.</p>

<p>One more quick tip, as I just learned this today.  When I run my tests and see the failures, there is usually a line number associated with the failure.  In the past, I would switch/open the test file, type gg to go to the top of the file and then type nnj, where nn equals the reported line number.  So if my failing test was on line 124, I would do the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gg
</span><span class='line'>124j</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until I found myself doing this way too often that I decided there had to be a better way.  This is vim, of course there is!  To accomplish the same task, more efficiently, one can use:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>:124&lt;cr&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And that is all I have for today.  I&rsquo;ve learned a lot more neat new stuff with vim, but I&rsquo;ll save that knowledge for a rainy day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whether you are the break<strong>or</strong> or the break<strong>ee</strong>, breaking up is hard to do.  I can
still rememeber years back when I broke up with my girlfriend at the time.  I
was the break<strong>ee</strong> and it was not easy. Emotions ran wild and I took it really
hard.  But in the end, it turned out for the better.  I met and married a
much better person.</p>

<p>As of this Friday, June 5th, I am breaking up from my Corporate marriage.  I
have been working for a large corporation, whether that be Merrill Lynch or
AT&amp;T, for 20 years.  Currently I am with AT&amp;T, approaching my 14th year with
them.  But I am leaving that life for a new one.  My new job will be as a
full time Ruby developer.  Something that I have been slowly training myself
for over the past 1.5 years.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t looking to leave AT&amp;T.  Overall, I&rsquo;ve been happy there.  And the
environment has been fairly stable.  I have repeatedly received high year
end evaluations.  I have been told how valuable I am to the team and how
others look to me.  And that is great.  However, as can be the case in the
corporate world, I&rsquo;m in a job &lsquo;band&rsquo;.  I&rsquo;ve asked to be bumped to a higher
band so that I could grow, but at this time they have not been able to
accommodate me.</p>

<p>So this time around, when I was asked by someone looking to hire a developer,
I said, &ldquo;&hellip;tell me more.&rdquo;  After learning about the new opportunity, and
thinking really hard, I decided to accept the job offer.  It was not an easy
decision &ndash; as I mentioned above, I&rsquo;ve been with AT&amp;T for almost 14 years. I
get paid pretty good, and have excellent benefits, including a nice 401k
plan.</p>

<p>But I made the decision to move in order to solidify my future.  I
believe that working as a full time Ruby developer, I will be able to
grow my knowledge rapidly, as well as expand my compensatation potential.  Along
the way, I will be building a solid path for my retirement &ndash; I can code from just
about anywhere, at anytime.</p>

<p>Once I&rsquo;ve been at the new job for about a month, I will write again about how things
are going.  Hopefully I will not come back and utter the words of Gob, from &lsquo;Arrested
Development&rsquo;, and say: <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a huge mistake.&rdquo;</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The dedicated and faithful reader of this old guy, would have noticed an extended
silence in this corner of the web.  I have, as the automated voice message of my
sons school would say, &ldquo;an unexcused absence.&rdquo;  While I won&rsquo;t make any excuses, I
would like to share what has kept me away from my writing.</p>

<p>Back in March I started to learn Swift by attending the Udacity iOS online program.
Udacity has partnered with the company I work at.  After successful completion of
the course, my company will reimburse me for the tuition.  About two weeks into
my training, the family and I went on a cruise.  Though I brought my laptop and
study material, I didn&rsquo;t spend much time Swift.</p>

<p>After our trip, and a hop-skip-jump over a week, it was time for Ancient City Ruby.
I enjoyed this years ACR conference, though I would have preferred a bit more
technical meat and less of the social fluffy stuff.  However, the most significant
part of ACR for me was meeting with another Ruby developer and getting accepted to
work part-time on a neat project.</p>

<p>The part-time project is my first &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; Ruby app that I&rsquo;ve been a part of.
Though I&rsquo;ve worked on some training apps or personal Rails apps, they have all been
small in scale compared to this new gig.  Being new to the project, and not knowing
much outside my experience with smaller apps, I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time
looking around and trying to get familiar with the applications structure.</p>

<p>And then came Rails Conference!  This year the conference was held in Atlanta, GA
which is not too bad a drive from Jacksonville, FL.  I hadn&rsquo;t yet been to a Rails
Conference, so of course I had to go.  Overall I enjoyed the time in Atlanta.  I
ran into a guy, David, who I had meet in Miami at Ruby Conf 2013.  Also, I got to
spend time with another developer that is working on the same project that I mentioned
above.</p>

<p>After the conference, I have been spending most of my evenings working on the
part-time project.  There is a lot to learn, but I am enjoying every minute of it.
The best part of my day is seeing my tests go green and being able to merge and
push my changes.</p>

<p>And that is my excuse, uh I mean my reasons, for not being active here for a while.
I had set a personal goal to publish a new post each month, and I&rsquo;m working to
raise the bar and publish twice a month.  Keep me honest &ndash; smack me via Twitter
if you feel I&rsquo;m slacking.  :)</p>

<p>Ok, now I&rsquo;d like to share a little snippet of code that illustrates something neat
I have learned while working on the part-time gig.  A great benefit of working on
a project with a mentor.  The first example is my original code before refactoring
to make it better and look a lot more &lsquo;Ruby-ish&rsquo;.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>  return nil
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And now the reveal &ndash; the pretty version which accomplishes the same thing.  Note
that during the refactor we re-named a few things, but the overall result was the
same.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While working on the Flex Blogger project, and studying the Bourbon website, in particular the <a href="http://refills.bourbon.io/">refills</a> side of the house, I liked the way their navigation bar looked.  In particular, I wanted to implement the search box feature.</p>

<p>So I grabbed their sample code and added it to the Flex Blogger project.  At first, I just brought over the raw html and eventually broke the code up into partials.  To keep things simple, I will focus on the syntax directly related to the search function, as seen below:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  &lt;div class="navigation-tools"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;div class="search-bar"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>        &lt;form role="search"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>          &lt;input type="search" placeholder="Enter Search" /&gt;
</span><span class='line'>          &lt;button type="submit"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>            &lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/refills/master/source/images/search-icon.png" alt="Search Icon"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>          &lt;/button&gt;
</span><span class='line'>        &lt;/form&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" class="sign-up"&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the Flex Blogger project, as with most of the Rails projects I have worked on, I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form">simple form</a>.  I use simple form simply because it was used in all the tutorials and learning material that I have digested.  So my mind focuses on simple form and I try to address any scenario that needs a form, by using <em>Simple Form</em>.</p>

<p>To help me work through my nav-bar search code, I refereneced some existing code in the Flex project, the category form partial:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>      &lt;%= f.input :description %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;div class="form-actions"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;%= f.button :submit %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;% end %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;br&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I struggled a bit trying to get the search in the nav bar to work with Simple Form.  After trying different things I reached out to a buddy, Shaun, who has helped me in the past.  We paired for a bit and after listening to what I was trying to do, and what I had tried, he asked me a <em>simple</em> question: &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you using a form_tag?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huh?  I thought that because I was using Simple Form that I needed to work within the boundaries of it.  I didn&rsquo;t realize that I could mix things when needed.  So off we went to the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/">rails api</a> and searched for &lsquo;form_tag&rsquo;.</p>

<p>You should be able to find form_tag under the ActionView::Helpers::FormTagHelper section.  From the documentation:</p>

<h4>form_tag(url_for_options = {}, options = {}, &amp;block) <BR></h4>

<blockquote><p>Starts a form tag that points the action to an url configured with url_for_options just like ActionController::Base#url_for. The method for the form defaults to POST.</p></blockquote>

<p>After the lesson, and referring to the api docs, the solution we used was as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>// _search_bar.html.erb
</span><span class='line'>&lt;div class="navigation-tools"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;div class="search-bar"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;%= form_tag("/search") do %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;%= text_field_tag :query, nil, placeholder: "Enter Search", type: "search" %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;%= button_tag type: "submit", id: "search-query" do %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>        &lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/refills/master/source/images/search-icon.png", alt: "Search Icon" &gt;
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;% end %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;% end %&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;/div&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I am <em>simply</em> amazed at how there is something new to learn just about everyday.  Just when I thought I was really comfortable with working things out with Rails/Ruby, I come across an opportunity to expand my ole grey matter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two weeks ago from today, at about this time I was kicked back in the main show room of the <strong>ms Nieuw Amsterdam</strong> waiting for the opening act to begin.  With a full stomach from an awesome meal, and a refreshing drink in hand, I was in full relax mode.  The last thing I was thinking about was code.</p>

<p>When I woke up, Monday morning, I had an itching to crack open the laptop and work on some things I had left hanging from two days prior.  But first, a quick stop for breakfast, then I headed to the ships library.  I was knocking out tasks one by one, committing away locally on my laptop.  Then instinctively, my muscle memory kicked in and before I could catch what I was doing, I typed:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git push origin master</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Duh!  You are on a ship, in the Caribbean, without a connection to the net.  No big deal, I can push my stuff to github when I return home.</p>

<p>I continued working on different things until I found myself stuck &ndash; I needed to refer to the api docs or some type of reference.  I was on vacation &ndash; the smart thing to do would have been to shut down my laptop and go relax.  Can you guess what I did?</p>

<p>Perhaps the thick-headed Irish blood in me, I decided to find a solution.  After a little digging, I found some gold nuggets in the following path:  ~/.gem/ruby/2.1.5/gems/rails-4.1.7/guides/source/</p>

<p>Reviewing some of the files in the above directory, I was able to get an answer for what I was looking for.  Saved my work, closed the laptop and headed to the gangway to catch a tender to a beautiful private island.</p>

<p>Later that day, while chatting with my dad, he let me know that he purchased a block of 200 minutes of internet time.  Satellite internet is not very fast, but good enough for quick browsing or checking of email.</p>

<p>I knew that I&rsquo;d be cracking open the laptop from time-to-time, and working on Flex Blogger as well as an app for my day job.  But I didn&rsquo;t want to burn through those sacred internet minutes when I needed to review either the Ruby or Rails APIs.  Surely there had to be a better way.  Of course there is, and I found the following site:</p>

<p><a href="https://rubydocs.org/">https://rubydocs.org/</a></p>

<p>One can visit the above site and download a local copy of the Ruby and/or Rails APIs.  The neat thing is, you can choose which version or Ruby or Rails that you want to download the documentation for.  Neat!</p>

<p>With a local copy of the documentation I was needing, I pushed my committed changes from the previous day, then logged out &ndash; only used about 15 minutes of our satellite internet.  :)</p>
