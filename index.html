  <div class="entry-content"><p>When meeting new people in the programming community, we frequently share what we do in our day jobs.  By day I primarily use Perl, though I have been slowly building up an arsenal of Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications.  But before learning Matz&rsquo;s Ruby, I learned a different flavor of Ruby.  And this &lsquo;aint your ruby.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When I first transitioned to the team I am on now, my primary duties were to provide tier three support of specialized networking equipment.  Our team can be split into two roles:  Tech Support/Project Management and Automation/Programming.  Over time, I migrated over to the Automation side. We use Perl for our tool server scripts and Ruby to get things started.  Off to the internet I went to learn Ruby, only to quickly find that our Ruby was not the Ruby I found online.</p>

<p>The Ruby we use at work stands for:  <strong>R</strong>ules yo<strong>U B</strong>uild <strong>Y</strong>ourself.  I believe the foundation or underlaying language is Java.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, our networking equipment sends events/traps to a trap collector.  That collector then does some processing on the event and forwards to our Ruby system.  We then perform certain actions using our Ruby based on the received alarms/events.  Below is an example code of &lsquo;our&rsquo; Ruby:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I got a bug, ney rather an itch I needed to scratch.  I have been using RVM for over a year and half.  I have had some issues, but mostly those were due to me learning how to work with RVM.</p>

<p>I was having an odd issue on one of my Macs so I decided to remove RVM and install rbenv.  I shot a tweet out to see if anyone had an opinion about rbenv and I received a reply suggesting I give chruby a chance.  Recently I had listened to an episode of Ruby Rogues <a href="http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/169-rr-version-managers-with-michal-papis-mislav-maronic-and-postmodern-mod-iii">#169</a>,  where they talked about RVM, rbenv, and chruby.</p>

<p>So I decied to give chruby a try.  Removing RVM is pretty straight forward.  You should be able to simply run:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rvm implode</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once removed, you may need to edit your .bashrc/.zshrc or *profile file(s) to remove any reference to RVM.</p>

<p>While I really like RVM, I&rsquo;ve always been a bit worried about the magic it performs &ndash; the stuff it does for me that I&rsquo;m not familiar with.  Chruby seemed to be easier for me to grasp.  From my limited understanding, there seems to be less moving parts in chruby vs. RVM.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to lay out all of the steps to get chruby installed.  The source web pages for chruby and ruby-install are very easy to read and comprehend.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby">chruby</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install">ruby-install</a></p>

<p>It took me a little bit to understand the differences of chruby and how I would use in my environment.  But after getting it running on my laptop, I converted two other Macs, my Ubuntu VM, and my CentOS server to use chruby.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, I do like RVM, and it had served me well.  I still use RVM at my day job on our CentOS servers.  I thought changing from RVM to chruby on those servers would be a good idea, so I attempted to change a development server.  While the removal of RVM and install of Chruby went fine, I ran into a huge issue.  I could not get Passenger to work properly under Chruby.  I&rsquo;m sure the reason is due to my lack of understanding, but I just couldn&rsquo;t affort to figure it out. So I switched back to RVM &ndash; and RVM will stay on our work servers.</p>

<time datetime="2014-11-04T07:20:45-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 4<span>th</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have many learning tools in my arsenal including Code School, Thoughtbot/Upcase, RailsCasts, Ruby Tapas, and too many other Internet based free resources to list.  But today I want to talk tapas, and borrow something that I learned from watching many episodes of Ruby Tapas.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve watched various episodes, I kept saying to myself, how is Avdi executing code right from within his text editor?  Is this some time of post production trickery?  Perhaps a green screen based laptop with a dash of After Effects?  But after some research, I learned that is wasn&rsquo;t some fancy magic, but rather an ability within his editor.  I believe that editor to be Emacs.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a Sublime Text user, and slowly dabbling with Vim.  So off to the online oracles to see if I could find a solution that would work in Sublime.  I did indeed find some solutions that said they were doing what Avdi can do &ndash; even referencing that they had the same desire as me.  However, I was not successful with getting Sublime to work the way I was expecting.  After spending several hours trying to force it to work, I gave up.  And I had a thought &ndash; surely this would be easier to get working with Vim.  :)</p>

<p>Getting the Tapas style in-line Ruby code execution to work in Vim was nice and easy.  I followed the instructions <a href="http://commandercoriander.net/blog/2012/10/10/evaluate-lines-of-ruby-in-vim/">here</a> and was up in running with very little effort.  For those that don&rsquo;t want leave from this fabulous reading, I&rsquo;ll summarize what needs to be done, first starting with the installation of a gem:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem install rcodetools</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we need to add a plugin to Vim.  Depending on your setup, you may need to add the .vim/bundle directory in your home directory.  But I already had this setup, so all I needed to do was the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cd ~
</span><span class='line'>cd .vim/bundle
</span><span class='line'>git clone https://github.com/t9md/vim-ruby-xmpfilter.git</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For a final bit of setup/configuration, we need to take a trip in editing the ~/.vimrc or ~/.vimrc.local file so we can do some mapping:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>nmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F4&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-mark)
</span><span class='line'>xmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F4&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-mark)
</span><span class='line'>imap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F4&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-mark)
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>nmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F5&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-run)
</span><span class='line'>xmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F5&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-run)
</span><span class='line'>imap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;F5&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;(xmpfilter-run)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The above mapping will allows us to mark (F4) what line(s) we want to see the results for of executing the ruby code, which we accomplish by pressing F5.  Let&rsquo;s step through an example to see how this works.  I&rsquo;ll show the example file through the various stages.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>1 class Person
</span><span class='line'>2   attr_accessor :name, :age
</span><span class='line'>3
</span><span class='line'>4   def initialize(name)
</span><span class='line'>5     self.name = name
</span><span class='line'>6     self.age = "Does it matter?"
</span><span class='line'>7   end
</span><span class='line'>8 end
</span><span class='line'>9
</span><span class='line'>10 p = Person.new('Kevin')
</span><span class='line'>11 p.name
</span><span class='line'>12 p.age</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next we will press F4 for the code we want to evaluate, line 11 below:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>1 class Person
</span><span class='line'>2   attr_accessor :name, :age
</span><span class='line'>3
</span><span class='line'>4   def initialize(name)
</span><span class='line'>5     self.name = name
</span><span class='line'>6     self.age = "Does it matter?"
</span><span class='line'>7   end
</span><span class='line'>8 end
</span><span class='line'>9
</span><span class='line'>10 p = Person.new('Kevin')
</span><span class='line'>11 p.name # =&gt;
</span><span class='line'>12 p.age</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And finally, EXECUTE (F5):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>1 class Person
</span><span class='line'>2   attr_accessor :name, :age
</span><span class='line'>3
</span><span class='line'>4   def initialize(name)
</span><span class='line'>5     self.name = name
</span><span class='line'>6     self.age = "Does it matter?"
</span><span class='line'>7   end
</span><span class='line'>8 end
</span><span class='line'>9
</span><span class='line'>10 p = Person.new('Kevin')
</span><span class='line'>11 p.name # =&gt; "Kevin"
</span><span class='line'>12 p.age</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Pretty neat, eh?  Borrowing this workflow from Ruby Tapas will now help me when I&rsquo;m following along with each episode.  Now I just need to get better with Vim.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of my Rails projects, for personal use and education, have been using Postgresql or SQLite for the datbase backend.  At work our primary database is Oracle with a dash of MySQL.  Recently we decided to use MySQL with all future development, and migrate our tools/applications that use Oracle to use MySQL.</p>

<p>I downloaded and installed MySQL by grabbing the installer from the MySQL website:  <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/</a> and getting the version for my operating system &ndash; OS X Mavericks.</p>

<p>However, with this version installed I was having issues with bundler and getting the mysql gem to compile.  I tried a few solutions that I found on the internet, but none of them were working.</p>

<p>I found some other people who had issues, when using OSX Mavericks, with the MySQL installer.  They solved the issue by removing MySQL that was installed from the download via dev.mysql.com and then re-installing using Homebrew.</p>

<p>This solution worked for me as well.  I found this a bit odd, because earlier in the year I had issues with installing Postgres via Homebrew.  The solution for Postgres was to remove the Homebrew installation and use the installer from the Postgres site.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While working on a Rails project last week I encountered an issue where some of my tests were failing.  It had been a while since I worked on this project so I had to re-familiarize myself with what was going on.</p>

<p>The tests were failing when editing a profile and adding an image.  I popped over to the browser and performed a manual test to get a better idea of what was going on.  That is when I saw the following error: <em>&ldquo;Paperclip::Errors::NotIdentifiedByImageMagickError&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>To attempt to fix the issue, I first performed a simple uninstall and re-install of imagemagic using homebrew:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>brew uninstall imagemagick
</span><span class='line'>brew install imagemagick</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This didn&rsquo;t solve the problem.  Imagemagic has a command line utility, convert, which one can use to see if the application is working.  I tried a simple test:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>convert moonie.jpg moon.png</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But I continued to get errors even with that simple test.  So off to the internet for some deep research.  I came across the following steps, which solved the issue I was having.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>brew update
</span><span class='line'>brew doctor
</span><span class='line'>brew uninstall libtool
</span><span class='line'>brew uninstall imagemagic
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>cd /Library/Caches/Homebrew
</span><span class='line'>rm imagemag*
</span><span class='line'>rm libtool-2.4.2.tar.gz
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>brew doctor
</span><span class='line'>brew install libtool --universal
</span><span class='line'>brew link libool --force
</span><span class='line'>brew install imagemagic --build-from-source</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After completing the above steps, the command line tool, convert was successful.  I re-tested the Rails application, both manually, and via my test suite, and all was green again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I covered a topic that resurfaced while I am in the process of upgrading one of our apps from Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.x. When I wrote that application I was a raw recruit &ndash; fresh to Ruby and Rails and just trying to get the idea to work.</p>

<p>But as I&rsquo;ve been improving my skills and expanding the ole grey matter, I wanted to write this new version, fully tested.  In the application there is a need to be able to export the data to a CSV formatted file.  I had the code from the old version of the app, and migrated it over.  However, I challenged myself to figure out how to write a test for the to_csv method in Baytech model.</p>

<p>Below is the code from the Baytech model:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def self.to_csv
</span><span class='line'>  CSV.generate(col_sep: ':') do |csv|
</span><span class='line'>    all.each do |baytech|
</span><span class='line'>      port = "X"
</span><span class='line'>      csv &lt;&lt; [baytech.name, baytech.phone_num, baytech.ip_addr, port, baytech.modem_type, port]
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I know the method works, as it has been working fine for 9 months or so now.  But I really wanted to figure out how to write a test for this method.  After much trial and error, along with research via books and google, I came up with the following solution:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>describe Baytech, '#to_csv' do
</span><span class='line'>  let(:baytech) { FactoryGirl.create(:baytech) }
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  before do
</span><span class='line'>    baytech
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  it { expect(Baytech.to_csv).to match /#{baytech.name}:#{baytech.phone_num}:#{baytech.ip_addr}:X:1:X/ }
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You may notice in the above code that I am referencing a Factory.  Here is a short version of that factory file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>FactoryGirl.define do
</span><span class='line'>  factory :baytech do
</span><span class='line'>    sequence(:name) {|n| "jaxfl0#{n}b9" }
</span><span class='line'>    sequence(:ip_addr) {|n| "10.1.2.#{n}" }
</span><span class='line'>    phone_num "7091234384"
</span><span class='line'>    region "USA"
</span><span class='line'>    modem_type "1"
</span><span class='line'>    ip_method "ssh"
</span><span class='line'>    active true
</span><span class='line'>    has_modem_line true
</span><span class='line'>    updated_by "cd1234"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    {-snip-}
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The keen eye may have caught something interesting in the to_csv method.  I&rsquo;m using an option, col_sep: &lsquo;:&rsquo; which allows me to use the : character as the delimiter instead of the default comma.</p>

<p>With the test in place, and passing, I felt better about the code in my to_csv method.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I re-discovered an issue I ran into about 8 months ago.  I am re-writing an application I created for work.  The first version was written in Ruby 1.9.x and Rails 3.x.  I built the app using sticks and glue &ndash; no testing.</p>

<p>We are migrating to Ruby 2.1.x and Rails 4.1.x and rather than copy over the app and tweak it, I wanted to take a better approach, a TDD approach.</p>

<p>It is a pretty simple application, with two main models &ndash; Baytech and Device.  A Baytech can have zero to many devices, and a device should only belong to one baytech.</p>

<p>To frameout my two models I used the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rails g model baytech
</span><span class='line'>rails g model device</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Everything seemed fine at first.  Until I started writing tests and code then I re-discovered a blast from the past.  What I didn&rsquo;t catch was that Rails, with its vast knowledge, pluralized both baytech and device as:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>bayteches</li>
<li>devices</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, all is cool with the plural version of device as devices.  But the plural of baytech is baytechs.  Oh crap, what do I do?</p>

<p>The first time this happened to me, it took me a while to figure out what the heck was going on.  Eventually all roads led me to the file config/initializers/inflections.rb</p>

<p>Taking a look inside this file, I found the following, or something similar:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
</span><span class='line'># are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
</span><span class='line'># locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
</span><span class='line'># ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, '\1en'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, '\1'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.irregular 'person', 'people'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.uncountable %w( fish sheep )
</span><span class='line'># end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
</span><span class='line'># ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.acronym 'RESTful'
</span><span class='line'># end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To cure my issue, I had to make one small change to this file, making use of inflect.irregular:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>  inflect.irregular 'baytech', 'baytechs'
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once that change was made, anytime there was a need for the plural version of baytech, Rails knew to use baytechs.  Yeah!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had the joy of installing Oracle 11g Express Edition on my home server.  That server runs CentOS 6.x as that is the flavor of Linux we use at my day job.  The server install is another story I will cover in the future, but today I would like to share how I got my laptop and development environment setup to connect to the Oracle Database.</p>

<p>Why in the world would I want to use Oracle you ask?  Well I don&rsquo;t really want to.  However, at the day job, that is what we use. And I wanted a more flexible development environment.  Due to limited resources, our &lsquo;dev&rsquo; database is also our disaster recovery database.  &lsquo;Nuff said?</p>

<p>In order to get my ruby environment setup to work with this monster database, I need two gems:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter', '~&gt; 1.5.0'
</span><span class='line'>gem 'ruby-oci8', '~&gt; 2.1.0'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a href="https://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced">Oracle Enhanced</a></p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself.  Lets take two steps back.</p>

<h2>Download some files</h2>

<p>On my server I have installed Oracle 11g Express, and my laptop is fairly current and run OS X Mavericks &ndash; a 64bit Operating System.  So let&rsquo;s get the appropriate client.</p>

<p>Download the required files from the Oracle Download site:
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/intel-macsoft-096467.html">Oracle Client</a></p>

<p>Note:  The following was learned by reviewing the blog over at: <a href="http://blog.codiez.co.za/2013/09/setup-oracle-instant-client-ruby-oci8-gem-mac/">codiez</a></p>

<p>For me, I downloaded these files:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>instantclient-sqlplus-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>instantclient-sdk-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Change to the directory where you downloaded the files
(e.g. cd Downloads &ndash; assuming you are in your home directory)</p>

<p>Unzip the three files:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-sqlplus-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-sdk-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Change directories to the new one created by the unzipping:
cd instantclient_11_2</p>

<p>Perform the following steps:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>10</span>

</span><span class='line'>mv * /usr/local/oracle/product/instantclient_64/11.2.0.4.0/bin/</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, we need to create and modify the tnsnames.org file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir -p /usr/local/oracle/admin/network
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>touch /usr/local/oracle/admin/network/tnsnames.ora
</span><span class='line'>vim /usr/local/oracle/admin/network/tnsnames.ora
</span><span class='line'>rubyrailssvr =
</span><span class='line'>  (DESCRIPTION =

</span><span class='line'>    (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVICE_NAME = XE))
</span><span class='line'>  )
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>rubyrailssvr.homenet.com =

</span><span class='line'>    (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVICE_NAME = XE))
</span><span class='line'>  )</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we need to get our environment setup. Create a .oracle_client file in your home directory:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>touch ~/.oracle_client
</span><span class='line'>vim ~/.oracle_client
</span><span class='line'>export ORACLE_BASE=/usr/local/oracle
</span><span class='line'>export ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/instantclient_64/11.2.0.4.0
</span><span class='line'>export PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
</span><span class='line'>export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
</span><span class='line'>export TNS_ADMIN=$ORACLE_BASE/admin/network
</span><span class='line'>export SQLPATH=$ORACLE_HOME/sqlplus/admin</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I use the bash shell at work, but have been working with zsh at home lately.  So below I show how to add the above oracle environment variables to both bash and zsh:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>echo "source ~/.oracle_client" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</span><span class='line'>source ~/.bash_profile
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>echo "source ~/.oracle_client" &gt;&gt; ~/.zprofile
</span><span class='line'>source ~/.zprofile</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Optional step &ndash; if needed, you may need to update your /etc/hosts file so that you can resolve the IP address of your server to a fully qualified domain name.  See the following example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>192.168.1.14    rubyrailssvr.homenet.com</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We are almost there &ndash; go take a break if you need to.  Before we update our Gemfile to add the two gems I listed earlier, let&rsquo;s first test and make sure we can connect.  We will use sqlplus to perform that test, which is a tool that was installed as part of the instant client.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>➜  ~  sqlplus system@192.168.1.14

<p>You should be able to connect now, though I have made a huge assumption.  I have assumed that your Oracle DB is currently configured to accept remote connections.</p>

<p>Well that wraps up todays episode.  Get out there and &hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been bad.  I let myself get consumed by my attendance of the on-line course at Bloc, and spending a lot of after-work-hours working on my personal project.  I have neglected my writing, and I apologize for my absence.</p>

<p>Earlier today I received notification from Disquis that someone, Nalani, had submitted a comment.  I am grateful for that comment as it reminded me of absence from this blog.  So with that nice kick-in-the-pants, let&rsquo;s move forward.</p>

<p>I completed my on-line training of the Bloc.io course on June 9th 2014.  Overall I was satisfied with the training and can confidently recommend it to others, depending on their situation.  What?</p>

<p>Bloc is not for everyone.  The first barrier to overcome is the cost.  I believe I got in before the price increase so the tuition was around $4250 if memory serves me correctly.  I believe the price to be fair for what you get.  However, I would not suggest that anyone plop down that money if they are currently struggling financially.</p>

<p>Depending on your employment needs, Bloc may not be for you.  For me, I took the course to better my programming skills and to assist me move forward with my personal project.  But I would not say that what I learned would allow me to get a job similar to what I have now, at my current pay rate.  I think the education would help one land a junior-developer job or an internship at a dev shop.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert, but from my experience with local dev shops here, there is a heavy emphasis on testing and Test-Drive-Development(TDD.)  And when I took the Bloc course, that area was lacking.  You can see my previous post for more information.</p>

<p>Yesterday I received an email from Bloc that indicated that they improving the Full Stack program by adding more testing to the course.  Not sure if it was my feedback, or feedback from many of us past students, but I&rsquo;m glad to see that they continuously improve on their product.</p>

<p>Is Bloc for you?  Maybe.  If you are like me, someone who has a day job and wanted to improve their programming skills, while trying to bring your product idea to life, then yes.  Maybe you are someone with a great idea, a founder, and want to get a better grip on what it will take to produce your product.  I think Bloc can help you there.  If you are trying to break ground in the industry and land your first job or internship, then yes, I think Bloc is for you.  If you need the extra hand holding while learning the basics, then yes I think you will get value from the Bloc program.</p>

<p>I do want to end with a note about the mentorship, and you may have read into my words at the end of the last paragraph.  If you are seeking what I consider advance knowledge and/or assistance, you may be dissapointed.  While I found the mentorship to be very helpful at the beginning and middle of my training, I was dissapointed at the end when it came to my capstone project.  Fortunately for me, about 8 weeks in to my Bloc training, I met a guy, Shaun, who became my &lsquo;external-mentor.&rsquo;  If not for him, I would not have been able to complete some of the Bloc assignments the way I wanted &ndash; via TDD.  Sure I could have completed them, but I want to develop by writing tests first.  Shaun has also helped me with my personal project and taken it so much farther than I could have done on my own.  What I&rsquo;m trying to end with is this &ndash; no matter if you take the training at Bloc or else where, find a mentor who will spend the time with you to help you learn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Picking up from where I left off with my block experience (see previous post, Week 2 and a half at Bloc,) a lot of good things, and some bad things, have occurred.  I had finished, what was called at the time, the third block, which included lessons on RSpec, Testing Users and both creating and destroying using Ajax.</p>

<p>The end of Block Three took me a bit longer to complete compared to how I progressed through the first two blocks.  The material in the third block was new to me.  It was during the end of this block, and creeping into the beginning of block four that I began to have issues with my mentor.  In the first two blocks, since I didn&rsquo;t need much help, I didn&rsquo;t mind that our sessions tended to be brief.  Usually they ran up to 10 minutes.  But our sessions are booked for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>My mentor during this time had missed a some meetings and had asked me to reschedule a few times.  I&rsquo;m flexible so I didn&rsquo;t see an issue.  But there was one time that I needed to reschedule and the mentor wouldn&rsquo;t work with me to make up the time.  Time much needed as I was having trouble with the project I had selected in Block Four &ndash; Saas Wiki Collaboration Tool.  I was getting very frustrated.</p>

<p>I reached out to student coordinator at Bloc, Karen, and discussed the issues I was having.  I explained that in the beggining I had gotten ahead, but now with all the problems I was encountering with this mentor, I was getting behind.  And I felt it very disrepectful that I was asked on several occasions to modify my schedule for him, but the one time I needed a re-schedule, he didn&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>Karen helped me out and let me pick out a new mentor.  She said that they would add a week to my enrollment to help make up for some of the lost time.  (Think I need to check on that because it doesn&rsquo;t look like they added a week.)  The new mentor, Charlie, was a huge improvment.  Never did I feel like he was trying to get me off the phone.  In fact, on several calls we went over the scheduled 30 minutes.</p>

<p>While working with the new mentor, Charlie, has been a much better experience, I feel that there is something missing from the program.  Although it is said that students will do pair programming and testing, I don&rsquo;t find either to come near what I was expecting.  It may be that my expectations are set to high from what the folks at Bloc had planned to offer.  I can understand that they have a range of differently skilled students.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m far off in saying that most newbies to this program probably don&rsquo;t care as much about testing as I do.</p>

<p>I find this mediocre approach to testing to transcend into the help one would get in the Office Hours Chat room.  I&rsquo;ll provide a brief example.  I was stuck on how to write a test that would make sure that any user, other than a logged in user, would not be able to access the ability to upgrade a users account by direct url navigation.  When I posed my question the answer I got was that I should use Pundit&rsquo;s policies and don&rsquo;t display the upgrade button unless the user is logged in and allowed to upgrade.</p>

<p>I had explained that I had already written tests for that, and the code to make the tests green, but I wanted to ensure that a malicous user would not be able to access the url for an upgrade directly.  The short answer I got was &ldquo;&hellip;well the users shouldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;  Yeah, well credit card thieves should not steal peoples credit card info and identies either, but I&rsquo;m sure the credit card companies do whatever they can to protect against those thieves.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t think the program was meant to take testing as seriously as I am.  It seems the program gives one just enough to say, &ldquo;&hellip; yeah I know how to test with RSpec.&rdquo;  Although I&rsquo;m happy with my mentor Charlie, I felt a bit frustrated on our calls when trying to work through testing issues.  So frustrated in fact that I stopped testing the proper way and just worked on trying to complete the assignment.</p>

<p>Bloc changed the student dashboard and I got really worried.  I was reviewing where I was in the program and the dashboard was telling me that I was behind.  The dashboard lists 5 projects, including the one I was working on, Saas Wiki Collaboration.  The sixth project is for our capstone.  Seeing that I had only four weeks left, and still hadn&rsquo;t finished this Wiki project, I got a bit frazzled.  It is not like I haven&rsquo;t been putting in the time!</p>

<p>On my mentoring call with Charlie last Friday I asked what the deal was.  There was no way I could finish all those projects and have time for my capstone.  My previous mentor had said that I only needed to pick one if I wanted to spend more time on the capstone project.  Luckily, Charlie confirmed that the dashboard was a bit confusing.  Students have the option to do more than one project before their capstone, but it is not required.</p>

<p>That made me feel a bit better, but I still needed to wrap up this Wiki project.  The main reason I took this course was to work on my capstone and have help when/where I needed via the mentorship and Office Hours Chat room.  Please don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I have learned a lot via the program, but my main goal is to work on my personal project.</p>

<p>With some &lsquo;external&rsquo; help, I was able to wrap up this Wiki project.  At least I believe it to be done according to the original requirements.  I even was able to get the Stripe intergration to work, with tests!  I&rsquo;ll have another blog post regarding the external help &ndash; stay tuned!</p>

<p>I have another mentoring call on Monday &ndash; 05/12/14.  We should be able to discuss my capstone project and get an idea of how to get started.  The nice thing about the Saas Wiki project is that there are a lot of components of that app which will apply to my capstone project.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more information regarding my experience at <a href="http://www.bloc.io">Bloc.io</a>  I will be publishing an overview of the program at the conclusion of enrollment.</p>
