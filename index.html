  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I covered a topic that resurfaced while I am in the process of upgrading one of our apps from Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.x. When I wrote that application I was a raw recruit &ndash; fresh to Ruby and Rails and just trying to get the idea to work.</p>

<p>But as I&rsquo;ve been improving my skills and expanding the ole grey matter, I wanted to write this new version, fully tested.  In the application there is a need to be able to export the data to a CSV formatted file.  I had the code from the old version of the app, and migrated it over.  However, I challenged myself to figure out how to write a test for the to_csv method in Baytech model.</p>

<p>Below is the code from the Baytech model:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def self.to_csv
</span><span class='line'>  CSV.generate(col_sep: ':') do |csv|
</span><span class='line'>    all.each do |baytech|
</span><span class='line'>      port = "X"
</span><span class='line'>      csv &lt;&lt; [baytech.name, baytech.phone_num, baytech.ip_addr, port, baytech.modem_type, port]
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I know the method works, as it has been working fine for 9 months or so now.  But I really wanted to figure out how to write a test for this method.  After much trial and error, along with research via books and google, I came up with the following solution:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>describe Baytech, '#to_csv' do
</span><span class='line'>  let(:baytech) { FactoryGirl.create(:baytech) }
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  before do
</span><span class='line'>    baytech
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  it { expect(Baytech.to_csv).to match /#{baytech.name}:#{baytech.phone_num}:#{baytech.ip_addr}:X:1:X/ }
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You may notice in the above code that I am referencing a Factory.  Here is a short version of that factory file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>FactoryGirl.define do
</span><span class='line'>  factory :baytech do
</span><span class='line'>    sequence(:name) {|n| "jaxfl0#{n}b9" }
</span><span class='line'>    sequence(:ip_addr) {|n| "10.1.2.#{n}" }
</span><span class='line'>    phone_num "7091234384"
</span><span class='line'>    region "USA"
</span><span class='line'>    modem_type "1"
</span><span class='line'>    ip_method "ssh"
</span><span class='line'>    active true
</span><span class='line'>    has_modem_line true
</span><span class='line'>    updated_by "cd1234"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    {-snip-}
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The keen eye may have caught something interesting in the to_csv method.  I&rsquo;m using an option, col_sep: &lsquo;:&rsquo; which allows me to use the : character as the delimiter instead of the default comma.</p>

<p>With the test in place, and passing, I felt better about the code in my to_csv method.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I re-discovered an issue I ran into about 8 months ago.  I am re-writing an application I created for work.  The first version was written in Ruby 1.9.x and Rails 3.x.  I built the app using sticks and glue &ndash; no testing.</p>

<p>We are migrating to Ruby 2.1.x and Rails 4.1.x and rather than copy over the app and tweak it, I wanted to take a better approach, a TDD approach.</p>

<p>It is a pretty simple application, with two main models &ndash; Baytech and Device.  A Baytech can have zero to many devices, and a device should only belong to one baytech.</p>

<p>To frameout my two models I used the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rails g model baytech
</span><span class='line'>rails g model device</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Everything seemed fine at first.  Until I started writing tests and code then I re-discovered a blast from the past.  What I didn&rsquo;t catch was that Rails, with its vast knowledge, pluralized both baytech and device as:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>bayteches</li>
<li>devices</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, all is cool with the plural version of device as devices.  But the plural of baytech is baytechs.  Oh crap, what do I do?</p>

<p>The first time this happened to me, it took me a while to figure out what the heck was going on.  Eventually all roads led me to the file config/initializers/inflections.rb</p>

<p>Taking a look inside this file, I found the following, or something similar:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
</span><span class='line'># are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
</span><span class='line'># locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
</span><span class='line'># ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, '\1en'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, '\1'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.irregular 'person', 'people'
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.uncountable %w( fish sheep )
</span><span class='line'># end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
</span><span class='line'># ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>#   inflect.acronym 'RESTful'
</span><span class='line'># end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To cure my issue, I had to make one small change to this file, making use of inflect.irregular:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
</span><span class='line'>  inflect.irregular 'baytech', 'baytechs'
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once that change was made, anytime there was a need for the plural version of baytech, Rails knew to use baytechs.  Yeah!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had the joy of installing Oracle 11g Express Edition on my home server.  That server runs CentOS 6.x as that is the flavor of Linux we use at my day job.  The server install is another story I will cover in the future, but today I would like to share how I got my laptop and development environment setup to connect to the Oracle Database.</p>

<p>Why in the world would I want to use Oracle you ask?  Well I don&rsquo;t really want to.  However, at the day job, that is what we use. And I wanted a more flexible development environment.  Due to limited resources, our &lsquo;dev&rsquo; database is also our disaster recovery database.  &lsquo;Nuff said?</p>

<p>In order to get my ruby environment setup to work with this monster database, I need two gems:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter', '~&gt; 1.5.0'
</span><span class='line'>gem 'ruby-oci8', '~&gt; 2.1.0'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a href="https://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced">Oracle Enhanced</a></p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself.  Lets take two steps back.</p>

<h2>Download some files</h2>

<p>On my server I have installed Oracle 11g Express, and my laptop is fairly current and run OS X Mavericks &ndash; a 64bit Operating System.  So let&rsquo;s get the appropriate client.</p>

<p>Download the required files from the Oracle Download site:
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/intel-macsoft-096467.html">Oracle Client</a></p>

<p>Note:  The following was learned by reviewing the blog over at: <a href="http://blog.codiez.co.za/2013/09/setup-oracle-instant-client-ruby-oci8-gem-mac/">codiez</a></p>

<p>For me, I downloaded these files:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>instantclient-sqlplus-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>instantclient-sdk-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Change to the directory where you downloaded the files
(e.g. cd Downloads &ndash; assuming you are in your home directory)</p>

<p>Unzip the three files:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-basic-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-sqlplus-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip
</span><span class='line'>unzip -qq instantclient-sdk-macos.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Change directories to the new one created by the unzipping:
cd instantclient_11_2</p>

<p>Perform the following steps:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>mv * /usr/local/oracle/product/instantclient_64/11.2.0.4.0/bin/</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, we need to create and modify the tnsnames.org file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir -p /usr/local/oracle/admin/network
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>touch /usr/local/oracle/admin/network/tnsnames.ora
</span><span class='line'>vim /usr/local/oracle/admin/network/tnsnames.ora
</span><span class='line'>rubyrailssvr =
</span><span class='line'>  (DESCRIPTION =

</span><span class='line'>    (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVICE_NAME = XE))
</span><span class='line'>  )
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>rubyrailssvr.homenet.com =

</span><span class='line'>    (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVICE_NAME = XE))
</span><span class='line'>  )</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we need to get our environment setup. Create a .oracle_client file in your home directory:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>touch ~/.oracle_client
</span><span class='line'>vim ~/.oracle_client
</span><span class='line'>export ORACLE_BASE=/usr/local/oracle
</span><span class='line'>export ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/instantclient_64/11.2.0.4.0
</span><span class='line'>export PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
</span><span class='line'>export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
</span><span class='line'>export TNS_ADMIN=$ORACLE_BASE/admin/network
</span><span class='line'>export SQLPATH=$ORACLE_HOME/sqlplus/admin</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I use the bash shell at work, but have been working with zsh at home lately.  So below I show how to add the above oracle environment variables to both bash and zsh:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>echo "source ~/.oracle_client" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</span><span class='line'>source ~/.bash_profile
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>echo "source ~/.oracle_client" &gt;&gt; ~/.zprofile
</span><span class='line'>source ~/.zprofile</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Optional step &ndash; if needed, you may need to update your /etc/hosts file so that you can resolve the IP address of your server to a fully qualified domain name.  See the following example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>192.168.1.14    rubyrailssvr.homenet.com</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We are almost there &ndash; go take a break if you need to.  Before we update our Gemfile to add the two gems I listed earlier, let&rsquo;s first test and make sure we can connect.  We will use sqlplus to perform that test, which is a tool that was installed as part of the instant client.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been bad.  I let myself get consumed by my attendance of the on-line course at Bloc, and spending a lot of after-work-hours working on my personal project.  I have neglected my writing, and I apologize for my absence.</p>

<p>Earlier today I received notification from Disquis that someone, Nalani, had submitted a comment.  I am grateful for that comment as it reminded me of absence from this blog.  So with that nice kick-in-the-pants, let&rsquo;s move forward.</p>

<p>I completed my on-line training of the Bloc.io course on June 9th 2014.  Overall I was satisfied with the training and can confidently recommend it to others, depending on their situation.  What?</p>

<p>Bloc is not for everyone.  The first barrier to overcome is the cost.  I believe I got in before the price increase so the tuition was around $4250 if memory serves me correctly.  I believe the price to be fair for what you get.  However, I would not suggest that anyone plop down that money if they are currently struggling financially.</p>

<p>Depending on your employment needs, Bloc may not be for you.  For me, I took the course to better my programming skills and to assist me move forward with my personal project.  But I would not say that what I learned would allow me to get a job similar to what I have now, at my current pay rate.  I think the education would help one land a junior-developer job or an internship at a dev shop.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert, but from my experience with local dev shops here, there is a heavy emphasis on testing and Test-Drive-Development(TDD.)  And when I took the Bloc course, that area was lacking.  You can see my previous post for more information.</p>

<p>Yesterday I received an email from Bloc that indicated that they improving the Full Stack program by adding more testing to the course.  Not sure if it was my feedback, or feedback from many of us past students, but I&rsquo;m glad to see that they continuously improve on their product.</p>

<p>Is Bloc for you?  Maybe.  If you are like me, someone who has a day job and wanted to improve their programming skills, while trying to bring your product idea to life, then yes.  Maybe you are someone with a great idea, a founder, and want to get a better grip on what it will take to produce your product.  I think Bloc can help you there.  If you are trying to break ground in the industry and land your first job or internship, then yes, I think Bloc is for you.  If you need the extra hand holding while learning the basics, then yes I think you will get value from the Bloc program.</p>

<p>I do want to end with a note about the mentorship, and you may have read into my words at the end of the last paragraph.  If you are seeking what I consider advance knowledge and/or assistance, you may be dissapointed.  While I found the mentorship to be very helpful at the beginning and middle of my training, I was dissapointed at the end when it came to my capstone project.  Fortunately for me, about 8 weeks in to my Bloc training, I met a guy, Shaun, who became my &lsquo;external-mentor.&rsquo;  If not for him, I would not have been able to complete some of the Bloc assignments the way I wanted &ndash; via TDD.  Sure I could have completed them, but I want to develop by writing tests first.  Shaun has also helped me with my personal project and taken it so much farther than I could have done on my own.  What I&rsquo;m trying to end with is this &ndash; no matter if you take the training at Bloc or else where, find a mentor who will spend the time with you to help you learn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Picking up from where I left off with my block experience (see previous post, Week 2 and a half at Bloc,) a lot of good things, and some bad things, have occurred.  I had finished, what was called at the time, the third block, which included lessons on RSpec, Testing Users and both creating and destroying using Ajax.</p>

<p>The end of Block Three took me a bit longer to complete compared to how I progressed through the first two blocks.  The material in the third block was new to me.  It was during the end of this block, and creeping into the beginning of block four that I began to have issues with my mentor.  In the first two blocks, since I didn&rsquo;t need much help, I didn&rsquo;t mind that our sessions tended to be brief.  Usually they ran up to 10 minutes.  But our sessions are booked for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>My mentor during this time had missed a some meetings and had asked me to reschedule a few times.  I&rsquo;m flexible so I didn&rsquo;t see an issue.  But there was one time that I needed to reschedule and the mentor wouldn&rsquo;t work with me to make up the time.  Time much needed as I was having trouble with the project I had selected in Block Four &ndash; Saas Wiki Collaboration Tool.  I was getting very frustrated.</p>

<p>I reached out to student coordinator at Bloc, Karen, and discussed the issues I was having.  I explained that in the beggining I had gotten ahead, but now with all the problems I was encountering with this mentor, I was getting behind.  And I felt it very disrepectful that I was asked on several occasions to modify my schedule for him, but the one time I needed a re-schedule, he didn&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>Karen helped me out and let me pick out a new mentor.  She said that they would add a week to my enrollment to help make up for some of the lost time.  (Think I need to check on that because it doesn&rsquo;t look like they added a week.)  The new mentor, Charlie, was a huge improvment.  Never did I feel like he was trying to get me off the phone.  In fact, on several calls we went over the scheduled 30 minutes.</p>

<p>While working with the new mentor, Charlie, has been a much better experience, I feel that there is something missing from the program.  Although it is said that students will do pair programming and testing, I don&rsquo;t find either to come near what I was expecting.  It may be that my expectations are set to high from what the folks at Bloc had planned to offer.  I can understand that they have a range of differently skilled students.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m far off in saying that most newbies to this program probably don&rsquo;t care as much about testing as I do.</p>

<p>I find this mediocre approach to testing to transcend into the help one would get in the Office Hours Chat room.  I&rsquo;ll provide a brief example.  I was stuck on how to write a test that would make sure that any user, other than a logged in user, would not be able to access the ability to upgrade a users account by direct url navigation.  When I posed my question the answer I got was that I should use Pundit&rsquo;s policies and don&rsquo;t display the upgrade button unless the user is logged in and allowed to upgrade.</p>

<p>I had explained that I had already written tests for that, and the code to make the tests green, but I wanted to ensure that a malicous user would not be able to access the url for an upgrade directly.  The short answer I got was &ldquo;&hellip;well the users shouldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;  Yeah, well credit card thieves should not steal peoples credit card info and identies either, but I&rsquo;m sure the credit card companies do whatever they can to protect against those thieves.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t think the program was meant to take testing as seriously as I am.  It seems the program gives one just enough to say, &ldquo;&hellip; yeah I know how to test with RSpec.&rdquo;  Although I&rsquo;m happy with my mentor Charlie, I felt a bit frustrated on our calls when trying to work through testing issues.  So frustrated in fact that I stopped testing the proper way and just worked on trying to complete the assignment.</p>

<p>Bloc changed the student dashboard and I got really worried.  I was reviewing where I was in the program and the dashboard was telling me that I was behind.  The dashboard lists 5 projects, including the one I was working on, Saas Wiki Collaboration.  The sixth project is for our capstone.  Seeing that I had only four weeks left, and still hadn&rsquo;t finished this Wiki project, I got a bit frazzled.  It is not like I haven&rsquo;t been putting in the time!</p>

<p>On my mentoring call with Charlie last Friday I asked what the deal was.  There was no way I could finish all those projects and have time for my capstone.  My previous mentor had said that I only needed to pick one if I wanted to spend more time on the capstone project.  Luckily, Charlie confirmed that the dashboard was a bit confusing.  Students have the option to do more than one project before their capstone, but it is not required.</p>

<p>That made me feel a bit better, but I still needed to wrap up this Wiki project.  The main reason I took this course was to work on my capstone and have help when/where I needed via the mentorship and Office Hours Chat room.  Please don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I have learned a lot via the program, but my main goal is to work on my personal project.</p>

<p>With some &lsquo;external&rsquo; help, I was able to wrap up this Wiki project.  At least I believe it to be done according to the original requirements.  I even was able to get the Stripe intergration to work, with tests!  I&rsquo;ll have another blog post regarding the external help &ndash; stay tuned!</p>

<p>I have another mentoring call on Monday &ndash; 05/12/14.  We should be able to discuss my capstone project and get an idea of how to get started.  The nice thing about the Saas Wiki project is that there are a lot of components of that app which will apply to my capstone project.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more information regarding my experience at <a href="http://www.bloc.io">Bloc.io</a>  I will be publishing an overview of the program at the conclusion of enrollment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This evening I attended the RubyJax OpenHacks event at Lilly&rsquo;s Cafe out at the beach.  I believe the normal schedule has the OpenHacks event on the third Thursday of each month.  I like to get to th event a bit early as parking in that area can be a royal pain.</p>

<p>Shortly after I settled in, another new guy to the group, Jesse, joined me.  I had met Jesse a previous week at one of the Code &amp; Coffee events.  We got to talk a little bit about ourselves and what we were trying to accomplish in our quest of learning.</p>

<p>Enter the third n00b, Josh.  I was starting wonder if Micah has set the three of us in a fun game of snipe hunting.  Get all the new people together and laugh at them from a distance.  :)  The three of chatter a bit back and forth for a while, sharing some of our experiences.</p>

<p>One can learn from others that are new to Ruby, or anything for that matter.  For example, Jesse shared a neat tool he was using with me called Dash (<a href="http://kapeli.com/dash">http://kapeli.com/dash</a>).  This is a neat little app that sources the documentation of too many to count languages and frameworks.  I downloaded the app while he was demonstrating, and was excited to see all of the reference material available for the subjects I was interested in.  And then some!</p>

<p>I shared my current experience with Bloc.io and demonstrated their website, including a sample of some of the lessons I had completed and the one I had just started &ndash; my big project.  About this time Michah had showed up and I know that at least I felt at ease.  Micah had helped me before with some learning and I was hoping to pick his brain again.</p>

<p>Before we get to that though, Josh took a turn at sharing some resources.  The one that really stuck out to me was this website:  <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/">http://gitimmersion.com/</a>  I found this site to be a great resource, for the beginner, in learning how to use git.  So far I&rsquo;ve made it up to lab 14.  What I find really useful about this site is that I will be able to use the lessons on the site to help educate my fellow team workers at my day job.  Trying hard to get us all to use version control.</p>

<p>Just at I was getting ready to ask Micah a question, we had another join our group.  I was surprised, but very please to see Paolo Perrota join our group.  I think it is safe to say that all of use new guys were very happy to be hanging with two Ruby Gurus.</p>

<p>Rounding out the evening I reached out for some help with a coding issue I was having.  For the OOB Web app that I&rsquo;ve been developing for the day job, I need to support an older app.  This app uses the same data that I&rsquo;m migrating to the web app.  But the data in the files that support the app need to be delimited with a : and contain fields that we no longer need.  I had been able to figure out how to build that information as a : delimited export via the browser, but what I really needed was a rake task that could build two text files.</p>

<p>Working with Micah, he showed me where I was doing things correctly, and where I was making some mis-steps.  Using his guidance I was able to finish writing my second rake job &ndash; exporting the data.  I don&rsquo;t recall if I have mentioned it before, but Micah also helped me construct my first rake job &ndash; importing the data.</p>

<p>The time at Lilly&rsquo;s flew by, but I&rsquo;m confident in saying that all of us newbies learned something useful.  Looking forward to the next Code &amp; Coffee and OpenHacks events.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Day two was a rough start for me.  I over slept a little bit so I didn&rsquo;t have time to get breakfast at home.  Luckily, there was some breakfast provided at the conference.  I&rsquo;m not a big carb eater, but I knew that if I didn&rsquo;t eat something, it would be a rough day.  So down went a half bagel, some fruit, a glass of water and a coffee chaser.</p>

<p>Starting out the day was someone I had heard of, but never met &ndash; Terence Lee.  Terence works at Heroku as well as participates on the Ruby core team as a contributor.  I enjoyed this talk because I&rsquo;ve been using Heroku in my knowledge quest and found the topic to be relevant.  I think we sometimes take for granted what is going on behind the scenes, by guys like Terence, to ensure easy deployment of our apps.  In summary &ndash; make sure you are off of Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2.</p>

<p>For day two, I took the most notes during the second talk by Craig Kerstiens.  He talked about Postgres which is the primary database that I&rsquo;ve been using in my Rails applications.  Craig confirmed something that I had encountered two days earlier &ndash; don&rsquo;t use homebrew for Postgres.  Download and use the Postgres.app from their website.  I had a lot of issues during my workshop due to homebrew and its installation of Postgres.  Along with good tips for Postgres related resources, I also learned new stuff like sequential scan vs index scan.  And using Gin for indexing when you have multiple values in a column vs the standard BTree index method.  Rounding out his talk, I walked away with a to-do list of required research on HStore and jsonb.</p>

<p>Lunch on day two was the only part of the conference I didn&rsquo;t like.  I am not a pasta fan at all and sadly didn&rsquo;t find much I could eat.  I ended up snacking on two pieces of cheese and a chunk of bread.  Where the meal failed for me, the desert was a home run!  So I filled up on desert and coffee.  Yup, I was a bit jittery for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>After lunch it was time for Aaron.  His presentation had both a healthy serving of comedic relief as well as filling geekery.  Who else but Aaron would code a way, using a webcam, to scan all of his Magic the Gathering cards and catalog their value?  Oh and did I mention there were cats?  Aaron urged the audience to help him test out one of his projects related to OpenCV.  We were to all send him a tweet with the words &ldquo;Photo Me&rdquo;.  The goal was for his program to see the tweet, take a picture of Aaron at that moment in time, and send the picture to the person who tweeted him.  Well it seems one variable wasn&rsquo;t accounted for &ndash; Twitter.  With a flood of incoming requests to his Twitter account, the &ldquo;enforcers&rdquo; locked his account.</p>

<p>Something that I had forgotten to mention earlier was that for most of the conference, Ben sat with me.  I really thought this was cool.  Most of the speakers sat together up front or to the side.  But I got to sit with Ben &ndash; just me and him.</p>

<p>Which brings me to one of Ben&rsquo;s friends &ndash; Konstantin.  Ben had made some reference to Konstantin in his presentation &ndash; well more like to Konstantin&rsquo;s bag which apparently got lost while enroute to a conference in the Philippines.  Konstantin had a good bit of humor in his presentation which focused on security.  It was very englightening to learn about the many different ways hackers try to compromise web applications, including Rails applications.  Both the Ruby and Rails teams make a great effort to eliminate/prevent security issues.  I&rsquo;ll admit there were parts of the talk that went over my head.  But overall, I found it very usefull and an area where I want to learn more.</p>

<p>Near the end of Konstantin&rsquo;s talk I started to feel the effect of not eating a proper lunch, and an overload of sweets.  I started getting a little light-headed.  So the end of the conference was a bit of a blur.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been to two Ruby related conferences &ndash; Ruby Conf 2013 in Miami, and now this one, Ancient City Ruby Conf 2014.  Although the one if Miami was much larger, I enjoyed the Ancient City one more.  I felt like I learned more at ACR and fit in better.  At the conference in Miami I very much felt like an outsider.  But at ACR I met a lot of people from all over the US and the world.  I am looking forward to another Ancient City Ruby conference in 2015!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The actual conference was split across two days, and followed the single-track format.  This was unlike my experience at Ruby Conf 2013 &ndash; Miami, which was multiple topics going on concurrently.  For the first day, the following speakers were lined up:  Leon Gersing, Justin Searls, David Copeland, Katrina Owen, Richard Schneeman, and Ben Lovell.  Of all those speakers, I only had ever heard of three, and as it so happened, met each one of them: Justin Searls, Katrina Owen and Ben Lovell.</p>

<p>In a quick summary of the day, I wrote the most notes from the talk by Leon, learned the most from Katrina&rsquo;s talk and laughed my ass off, and learned some stuff, from Ben&rsquo;s talk.  Justin talk also had my interest and I had jotted down some notes from his presentation.</p>

<p>I really liked Leon&rsquo;s talk as to me it was not directly programming/developer related, but more so a spiritual and inspirational discussion.  I don&rsquo;t know if it was planned this way, but I believe it was perfectly executed as the first talk of the day &ndash; really set a good mood and environment.  Something that Leon said really moved me.  He said: &ldquo;Twitter, Facebook, Instagram are all simulations of relationships.&rdquo;  I thought that was very powerful.</p>

<p>Before I continue, I just want to say that I enjoyed all of the talks from the speakers on this day.  But given my current skill level with Ruby and as a programmer, some of the talks were more moving and relevant to me.  I&rsquo;m sure others had similar, but different results.</p>

<p>Three speakers in, some brief talks by some sponsors as well as lightening talks, and it was time for lunch.  I really enjoyed the lunch that was provided at the hotel for the conference.  Not only was the meal yummy, but the deserts were great as well.</p>

<p>On a nice full stomach, with a big smile on my face, it was time for Katrina&rsquo;s talk.  I really enjoy her presentation style and I feel that the delivery was at a level that I was able to absorb.  Katrina took us through a refactoring session for &ldquo;Bob.&rdquo;  Frightenly, some of that code looked familiar :)  If you get a chance, you can check out her prentation at: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kytrinyx/overkill">Overkill</a></p>

<p>Being the last speaker on a given day is a tough task.  People tend to start getting tired.  Leave it to Ben to fire up the crowd.  He had all of us rolling with laughter from his opening remarks to his closing arguments.  And along the way we learned a bit about testing APIs.  Watch out for those &ldquo;f#$@ing sharks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Day one didn&rsquo;t actually end after Ben&rsquo;s talk.  That evening some of the conference attendees went on the Ghost Ride, while the rest of us got to do the Pirate Ship adventure.  Even though I live in Jacksonville, which isn&rsquo;t too far from St. Augustine, I had not ever been on the Pirate Ship.  It was a lot of fun.  I just wish that I had my heavier hoodie and it got a bit cold on the water.  On the ship I got to meet a few other people from Hash Rocket, including Paul Elliott.  I had heard Paul&rsquo;s voice on several episodes of the Ruby5 podcast, and it was nice to meet him in person.</p>

<p>All-in-all, day one was a big hit for me.  Oh, I almost forgot!  At the beginning of the day, before the first talk started, I got to meet and shake hands with Aaron Patterson.  Yeah, you could say I&rsquo;m a fanboi of his.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my last post I discussed events prior to Ancient City Ruby 2014.  Now it is time to discuss my experience at the actual workshop and conference.  The conference part was spread across two days, Thursday and Friday, and there was an optional workshop day &ndash; Wednesday.  There were three different workshops offered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refactoring Rails by Katrina Owen</li>
<li>Rock@Vim by Jon Allured and Micah</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails: First Expedition by Beverly Nelson</li>
</ul>


<p>I had a tough decision to make.  I really wanted to attend Katrina&rsquo;s workshop, but I don&rsquo;t believe my skill set is good enough at this time to have been able to participate.  I thought that I&rsquo;d surely slow the class down.  On the other hand, I think I&rsquo;m beyond the Ruby on Rails: First Expedition level.  I am horrible at Vim, so it seemed obvious that I should sign up for the Rock@Vim workshop, and I did.</p>

<p>The Vim workshop was taught by two Hashrocket employees, Jon and Micah.  I&rsquo;d never met Jon before as he works out of the Chicago office.  But I have met Micah before, and he has helped me out a few times when I have gotten stuck or had questions.  Having some familiarity with a teacher was a plus.</p>

<p>I really wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect for the workshop, or how we would approach the topic.  I just want to get better at Vim.  Primarily, being better at vim would help at my day job as we ssh to most of our devices.  But I also want to try pair programming and from what I&rsquo;ve researched, one really needs to know vim.</p>

<p>The workshop started off good.  Jon and Micah introduced us to dotmatrix:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git clone https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix.git</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I don&rsquo;t know all the ins and outs but I guess I would summarize it as saying that by using dotmatrix I was able to configure my environment to by more &ldquo;HashRocketey&rdquo;  From the README.md file:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dotmatrix is a collection of dotfiles used at Hashrocket to customize various development tools. This project is the culmination of many years worth of tinkering with our favorite tools to get them to behave just right. We think using dotmatrix makes working with these tools more pleasant and hope you will too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were a few steps involved to get everything up and running, but I won&rsquo;t bore you with those details.  After the class was all setup, or at least we thought we were setup, we moved on to cloning a practice Rails project which we were going to use in our lessons for vim.</p>

<p>During part of the lesson I experienced an issue.  For some reason I was getting hung up with some issues involving Postgres.  I started to fall behind the class as I was trouble shooting.  Finally I just asked &ndash; &ldquo;&hellip; can I switch this project to SQLite to get beyond these problems?&rdquo;  Jon agreed that would be a good idea.  So I switched and tried to catch up.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t going well for me.  Working with my Postgres issue caused me to miss some key instructions and details that the rest of the class had observed.  Instead of fighting to try to figure things out, I just sat back and tried to focus.  I guess Micah saw that I was having some trouble so he came over to assist.  When I explained my situation he helped to get me back on track and also has Jon show me some stuff that helped to get me caught up.</p>

<p>At about the time I got caught up, we were quickly coming upon lunch time.  There was only four of us students plus Jon and Micah.  So we all went out to lunch together at A1A Ale Works.  It was a good time.  The advantage of a small class enabled us to be able to get to know each other and see what each others experience was like.</p>

<p>After lunch we were back at the brain fillage.  I was starting to get a bit tired, and it seemed like the topics were getting harder.  But we pressed on and learned some more neat things with using vim.  I learned enough during the workshop to make me want to learn more.  I will continue my vim learning, using what I absorbed in the workshop as a foundation, and utilize other resources like Vim Genius (<a href="http://vimgenius.com/">http://vimgenius.com/</a>) and the cool screencast series Vimcasts (<a href="http://vimcasts.org/">http://vimcasts.org/</a>).  Also, I picked up a copy of &ldquo;Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought,&rdquo; by Drew Neil who also produces the vimcasts.</p>

<p>Although I had some tough, frustrating moments, overall I enjoyed the Vim workshop.  Whether Jon knew it or not, he gave me a homework assignment.  As I was practicing at home that evening, I noticed that my prompt in the terminal was really long.  I prefer the following format:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>jfhogarty@Serenity:(source+*-)$</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So I had to figure out how to fix my prompt.  It wasn&rsquo;t too hard, just an edit to my ~/.bashrc file.  In my next post I will review my experience of the first day of the conference.  Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday was the conclusion of Ancient City Ruby 2014.  But I&rsquo;d like to take us back in time a few days and review how my experience went.  For me, the journey began on the early morning of Tuesday, April 1st.  What I am about to say is not an Aprils Fool joke, though I did get fooled Tuesday morning by Sphero and the selfieBot.</p>

<p>Every Tuesday, Hashrocket hosts an event called &ldquo;Code &amp; Coffee.&rdquo;  On a normal day of C&amp;C I will see some of the regulars &ndash; Micah, Johnny, DL, Eugene and Stuart. (Hope I spelled those names correctly!)  And sometimes there will be a new person &ndash; I was the new person a few months back.  But when I saw this guy walk in, he had a look of familiarity.  In my mind I knew the face, but not the name.  He walked over to the table where several of us had our laptops open, and introducted himself as Justin Searls.  WAT?  No way, one of the panelist is at C&amp;C and he is talking to me?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go back in time a few days prior to the event. I was checking out Twitter and saw that one of the panelist, someone who I look up to in a huge way, was asking if anyone wanted to share a cab ride from JAX to the venue in St. Augustine.  So I took a chance and offered to transport this panelist, Katrina Owen, from the Airport to St. Augustine.  Honestly I wasn&rsquo;t sure if there would be a response.  My experience with Twitter, for the most part, is many people want a horde of followers, but they seldom respond when a follower, me for example, tweets them.</p>

<p>I should have remembered that this is the Ruby community and they are much more friendly and responsive.  Katrina accepted my offer and I was like a kid that just learned that his parents are taking him to Disney.  But wait, there is more!  Another of the panelist was looking for a ride so the offer was extended.  Surely I wouldn&rsquo;t be so lucky to have two gurus in my vehicle.  Offer Accepted!  The second panelist to brighten my day was Ben Lovell.</p>

<p>With what appeared to be luck on my side, I decided to go for a trifecta.  I sent an email to Aaron Patterson asking if he needed a ride.  How cool would that have been to have three gurus to hang with?  But the Ruby gods clearly thought I was pushing my luck.  I was priveledged enough to have two gurus to share some time with.</p>

<p>Fast forward a bit in time to Tuesday late afternoon.  I finished with some work for my day job and headed to the airport.  I was still in a state of slight disbelief.  Would these two panelist actually be at the airport and let me have the privelege of transporting them?  Ben&rsquo;s flight was a little delayed, but it actually worked out better for me.  I got the text message that they had their luggage and were ready for pickup at the B pickup area.  As I rolled up to the curb, my slight feelings of disbelief sub-sided and my internal flame of happiness was a well, &ldquo;flame on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a way, I wished that the drive time from JAX to the hotel(s) in St. Augustine was longer.  It was great to have Katrina and Ben all to myself.  Perhaps a bit selfish on my part, but I really did enjoy their company and having a casual conversation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to break up my experience into several parts, with this being the first.  I will next talk about how my experience went with the workshop I signed up for &ndash; Vim with Jon and Micah.  After that, I&rsquo;ll chat a bit about how the main days, Thursday and Friday, went at Ancient City Ruby 2014.</p>
