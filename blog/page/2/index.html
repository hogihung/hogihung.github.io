  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my quest for knowledge, I&rsquo;ve come across a myraid of good online resources.  In today&rsquo;s blog I will share with you what sites I have found to be useful &ndash; some are free and some are not.</p>

<p>After struggling a bit in my pursuit of creating my idea using the Zend PHP framework, I bumped into a guy, Shay, who pointed me in the direction of Rails.  I remember clearly two sites he told me to check out:</p>

<p><a href="http://railscasts.com">http://railscasts.com</a> and <a href="http://tryruby.org">http://tryruby.org</a></p>

<p>Upon completing the tryruby online course I believe it suggested that I visit the site:  <a href="http://railsforzombies.org.">http://railsforzombies.org.</a>  Both the tryruby.org and railsforzombies.org sites are products of <a href="http://codeschool.com.">http://codeschool.com.</a>  Code School has both free and pay-for content.  After completing their free courses, and viewing some of the free episodes of Code TV, I signed up for a yearly membership.</p>

<p>Another site I ran into was <a href="https://peepcode.com/.">https://peepcode.com/.</a>  I liked what I saw with some of their free episodes and I signed up for a year membership.  Shortly after, Peep Code was picked up by Plural Sight and my membership was transferred at no additional cost.  This was a great deal!  I got access to everything I had previously at Peep Code, plus a ton of new great content at Plural Sight.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also viewed some of the free content at <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/.">http://teamtreehouse.com/.</a>  I like what I have seen so far, but have not yet signed up for their service.  They are a bit more pricey than Code School and Plural Sight.  Part of the reason I&rsquo;m holding off with Treehouse is because I&rsquo;m seriously considering a boot camp.</p>

<p>Boot Camps &ndash; There are both physical and online boot camps available.  I work full time and don&rsquo;t really want to travel to New York or San Francisco at this time.  So in my search of online education, I&rsquo;ve narrowed down three that look promising &ndash; <a href="http://bloc.io,">http://bloc.io,</a> <a href="http://gotealeaf.com">http://gotealeaf.com</a> and <a href="http://thinkful.com.">http://thinkful.com.</a>  So far bloc.io is my first choice, but I need to reach out to Tea Leaf Academy for more information.</p>

<p>Wrapping up, I want to share a few more resources.  Although these are not directly related to Ruby or Rails, they do fit in with expanding ones education in programming.  First, I really want to get better with Vim and you can watch free screencasts on vim over at: <a href="http://vimcasts.org/">http://vimcasts.org/</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still not very comfortable around JavaScript and CoffeeScript so I like these two sites:  <a href="http://coffeescript.org">http://coffeescript.org</a> and <a href="http://jsforcats.com/">http://jsforcats.com/</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Welcome to my blog.  I&rsquo;m just an old guy that is trying to learn new tricks every day.  Well, I&rsquo;m an old guy in the sense that my daughter came up to me one day and asked if I had used quills to write with when I was in school.  Though I did use a quill in art class it wasn&rsquo;t because that is all we had &ndash; it was just to illustrate how the tool worked.</p>

<p>There is a saying along the lines of <em>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t teach an old dog new tricks.&rdquo;</em>  I don&rsquo;t really believe this and I thought I&rsquo;d twist the words a bit and use it as a catchy domain name, thus &ndash; OldGuyNewTrick.com</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t consider myself old as a mid-forties guy, but for keeping with the fun, I&rsquo;ll play the role of an old guy and the context of a &lsquo;trick&rsquo; is me learning how to code in Ruby and Rails.  Well actually web development in general, but the focus is on Ruby and Rails.</p>

<p>I will leverage this blog to document my journey and share my experiences.  Years ago I had toyed with blogs and tools like WordPress.  I really hadn&rsquo;t given any thought to starting a new blog until I heard several well known people in the Ruby community, for example Ben Orenstein, suggest that if one is a programmer, they should have a blog.</p>

<p>Will anyone ever read this?  Why have a blog?  At first I disagreed with them and wasn&rsquo;t going to do it.  But it was like the universe was talking to me.  The topic of having a blog kept coming up in conversations, podcasts, and screencasts.  And I had a thought &ndash; even if no one reads this but me, it will still be useful.  By writing down my experiences I will have a good reference to look back on.  I may figure out a solution to a problem this week, and have a similar one a year from now.  But being an old guy, I may not remember, so I can refer back to this blog.</p>

<p>I am not well known in the programming community, but I plan on making a dent in the community.  On twitter and github I go by hogihung.  I wouldn&rsquo;t get all giddy and jump over to GitHub to see what I&rsquo;ve done &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be disappointed.  Remeber, I&rsquo;m new at this.  All I have is learning demos up there at the moment.</p>

<p>Ho Gi Hung is my Chinese name and I tend to use it as my internet persona.  My given name is John F. Hogarty, glad to meet you.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/avatar_jh.jpg" width="80" alt="My Avatar" /></p>

<p>One last item to note &ndash; this blog is created using Octopress and hosted on GitHub.  I&rsquo;m still learning how all this works, so please bear with me as I work out the kinks.  :)</p>
