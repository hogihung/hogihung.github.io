  <div class="entry-content"><p>While the focus, and majority of posts I plan on making, will revolve around the world of Ruby and web devlopement, my journey began with <em>&ldquo;Programming in Objective-C,&rdquo;</em> by Stephen G. Kochan.  While still persuing iOS and Objective-C knowledge, I also got <em>&ldquo;iOS Programming The Big Nerd Ranch Guide,&rdquo;</em> by Joe Conway &amp; Aaron Hillegass.  Shortly after I grabbed <em>&ldquo;Objective-C Programming The Big Nerd Ranch Guide,&rdquo;</em> by Aaron Hillegass.</p>

<p>Wadding through those books I quickly realized that I had a huge lack of knowledge, and though I really wanted to write iPhone apps, I needed to reboot and try a different approach.  I found an online course via iTunes-U which used the next book I purchased &ndash; <em>&ldquo;The Art &amp; Science of Java, An Introduction to Computer Science,&rdquo;</em> by Eric S. Roberts.  This book is used with the online course I subscribed to in iTunes, and by far the most expensive book I have purchased!  While reading that book, and following the course, I realized another gap in knowledge.  A lot of buzzwords were flying at me &ndash; OOP, Object Oriented Design, UML, Singleton, Design Patterns, etc.  So I did a little research on Amazon, and grabbed two new books by Head First &ndash; <em>&ldquo;Object-Oriented Analysis &amp; Design,&rdquo;</em> by McLaughlin, Pollice &amp; West and <em>&ldquo;Design Patterns,&rdquo;</em> by Freeman &amp; Freeman.  The Head First books used Java in their examples and I thought things were coming together. My Rails journey actually started because of <em>&ldquo;Object-Oriented Analysis &amp; Design&rdquo;</em> book.</p>

<p>Alrighty, lets now dive into the here and now.  My first Ruby/Rails book, and the one I would first suggest to anyone new to Rails, was <em>&ldquo;Ruby on Rails Tutorial,&rdquo;</em> by Michael Hartl.  This book won&rsquo;t be the end of your journey, but should give one enough to get a good understanding.  I plan on re-reading this book after I get through some others.  The next book I grabbed was probably way above my level, but I really enjoyed how this person thinks after watching some of her videos &ndash; <em>&ldquo;Practical Object-Oriented Design In Ruby,&rdquo;</em> by Sandi Metz.  Though a bit over my head for a good chunk of the book, I still found it very useful and I think I will understand more of what she wrote as I learn and experience more code.</p>

<p>The next book I got was <em>&ldquo;Agile Web Development with Rails 3.2,&rdquo;</em> by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hansson.  I found this to be very useful for filling in some gaps I had from the Rails Tuts book.  I happened to notice after I bought the book that a newer version would come out later in the year.  So I pre-ordered <em>&ldquo;Agile Web Development with Rails 4,&rdquo;</em> by the same trio.  I have not ready beyond the first chapter of this book yet.</p>

<p>One thing I was noticing from my reading experience of the two Rails books and the POODR book, I lacked some basic knowledge of the underlying language &ndash; Ruby.  So I grabbed <em>&ldquo;The Ruby Way,&rdquo;</em> by Hal Fulton.  I&rsquo;ve finished about half of the book and it cleared some things up for me.  I do use it as a reference from time-to-time and do want to get back into it for the second half.  Note I think this is the oldest of the Ruby/Rails books I have, so it isn&rsquo;t current.  But the majority of what you would read should still be relevant.</p>

<p>It might just be me, but I&rsquo;ve found that frequently I need information from multiple sources in order for me to understand certain topics.  So while <em>&ldquo;The Ruby Way&rdquo;</em> is very comprehensive, I picked up <em>&ldquo;The Ruby Programming Language,&rdquo;</em> by David Flanagan &amp; Yukikiro Matsumoto.  This book covered Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 so it was a little more up to date than the previous mentioned book.  Where as those first two book on Ruby will give you the meat of the language, I found this next book to be the sauce &ndash; <em>&ldquo;Eloquent Ruby,&rdquo;</em> by Russ Olsen.</p>

<p>I skipped a book, and in all honesty, I don&rsquo;t remember where in the order of books purchased that this one occurred.  I&rsquo;ve only read the first chapter and I like the book, but my mindset isn&rsquo;t ready for it.  I&rsquo;ll probably get virtually whipped for saying that, but I will revisit this book &ndash; <em>&ldquo;The RSpec Book,&rdquo;</em> by David Chelimsky.  For those new to Ruby and don&rsquo;t understand why I would be whipped, I&rsquo;ve found that the Ruby/Rails community is heavily into testing &ndash; BDD (behaviour driven-development) or TDD (test driven-devlopment).  I know this is an area I need to focus on!</p>

<p>Winding down there are a few more books.  I picked up the next book because I wanted more information on creating command line Ruby applications, so I purchased <em>&ldquo;Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby 2,&rdquo;</em> by David Bryant Copeland.  I really am enjoying this book and I&rsquo;m applying some of the things I&rsquo;ve learned to how I code work related stuff in Perl.</p>

<p>Although not directly related to Ruby or Rails, I picked up <em>&ldquo;The Little Book on CoffeeScript,&rdquo;</em> by Alex MacCaw.  They were not kidding, it is little!  I can&rsquo;t really say anything good about this book yet as I was disappointed at its size when it arrived.  I tossed it aside to read some other time &ndash; maybe on a rainy day.  The other non-directly related book I am enjoying is &ndash; <em>&ldquo;Practical Vim,&rdquo;</em> by Drew Neil.  I&rsquo;ve always admirred people who are awesome at the command line and in tools like Vim.  I&rsquo;m not one of them.  My preferred editor is Sublime Text, but I really want to learn Vim.  This book is good, and Drew produces some cool screencasts &ndash; <a href="http://vimcasts.org.">http://vimcasts.org.</a></p>

<p>Down to my last two physical books as of 2/19/2014 &ndash; <em>&ldquo;Ruby Under a Microscope,&rdquo;</em> by Pat Shaughnessy and <em>&ldquo;Seven Databases in Seven Weeks,&rdquo;</em> by Eric Redmond and Jim R. Wilson.  <em>&ldquo;Ruby Under a Microscope&rdquo;</em> is probably not a good fit for someone new to Ruby, but I&rsquo;m finding it absolutely enjoyable.  Sure there are things above my head, but I am able to digest most of the information and it actually helps me understand the language better.  I just received the Seven Databases book and haven&rsquo;t had a chance to read it yet.</p>

<p>All of the above are physical books I&rsquo;ve purchased in my persuit of learning to code.  I&rsquo;ve also purchases a few eBooks which I will list next.  I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of eBooks related to programming as I find the formatting tends to get screwed up when the authors try to show code blocks.  With that said, on my Kindle I have:  <em>&ldquo;Confident Ruby,&rdquo;</em> by Avdi Grimm, <em>&ldquo;Professional JavaScript for Web Developers,&rdquo;</em> by Nicholas C. Zakas, and <em>&ldquo;CoffeeScript Programming with jQuery, Rails and Node.js,&rdquo;</em> by Michael Erasmus.</p>

<p>There are two other books, and I wasn&rsquo;t going to inlude them, but just in case you want books on CakePHP or PHP Zend Framework, I strongly urge you TO STAY AWAY from: <em>&ldquo;Easy PHP Websites with The Zend Framework,&rdquo;</em> by W. Jason Gilmore, and <em>&ldquo;CakePHP 1.3 Application Development Cookbook,&rdquo;</em> by Mario Iglesias.  These two books are horrible!</p>

<h2>Apology</h2>

<p>When I first skechted out the list of books in my arsenal, it didn&rsquo;t look to be to long.  But as we can see from the above, when I wrapped words around the book names, this post got pretty long.  So I apologize for that.  I will make a great effort going forward to keep my posts shorter.  If needed, break up a long topic into multiple posts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My journey to learn Ruby and Rails started almost one year ago.  I&rsquo;m embarrased to admit, aside from a couple of lunch meetings, I&rsquo;ve been traveling down this road on my own.  Being new to the language and community, plus the fact that I&rsquo;m an introvert, I found it hard to get out and meet fellow programmers.</p>

<p>Near the end of last year I decided to try and conquer my fear and looking back on it, I probably should have started with a smaller introduction to the Ruby community.  In November of last year I attended Ruby Conf 2013 in Miami, Florida.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I enjoyed almost everything about my experience there.  But I felt so out of place.  I went by myself and had no clue on what to expect.</p>

<p>After my experience with Ruby Conf, I decided that I need to take a more gentle approach to entering the fabulous programming community.  I looked up RubyJax since I live in Jacksonville, FL.  I saw that they host many events &ndash; most at the Hash Rocket office at Jax Beach.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve signed up for as many meet ups as I could, which include <em>&ldquo;Code and Coffee.&rdquo;</em>  This was hard for me on a couple of levels.  First, I still feel inadequate as new member of the Ruby community.  Second, I work from home and am really not a morning person.  To get up at 6:15am so I have time to shower and drive to Jax Beach is a bit tough.  It was especially tough for me today, my second Code &amp; Coffee, because I was not feeling 100%.  I enjoyed going last week but in my mind it was clear I was the new guy and I felt really dumb as I was surrounded by so many great programmers.</p>

<p>Then something happened.  At this second Code &amp; Coffee, I wasn&rsquo;t the new guy anymore.  A new member showed up, I believe his name was Michael, and I was able to talk with him and give some advice based on my experience as a new person to the Ruby community.  I hadn&rsquo;t realized how far I have come in my journey.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still have far to go, but when that light bulb went off in my head, it really brightened my day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently purchased a copy of &ldquo;Confident Ruby&rdquo; by Avdi Grimm.  I have not gotten
far in the book yet, but I am enjoying it.  In the chapter titled &ldquo;Use built-in
conversion functions&rdquo; I came across a block of code that made me pause.  Being a
new recruit of the Ruby Army, I only have a grasp on the basics.  The method that
I have below probably makes sense to an experienced Rubyist, and other programming
veterans, but to me it didn&rsquo;t.  I wanted to know exactly what each line of code
meant, and what was going on.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>def pretty_int(value)
</span><span class='line'>  decimal = Integer(value).to_s
</span><span class='line'>  leader  = decimal.slice!(0, decimal.length % 3)
</span><span class='line'>  decimal.gsub!(/\d{3}(?!$)/,'\0,')
</span><span class='line'>  decimal = nil if decimal.empty?
</span><span class='line'>  leader  = nil if leader.empty?
</span><span class='line'>  [leader,decimal].compact.join(",")
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>First we are setting a variable, decimal, equal to the result of passing whatever we submitted for &lsquo;value&rsquo; to the conversion function, Integer, which then gets converted to a string via the to_s method.</p>

<p>We can confirm that decimal is a string if we add a little code after that first line above:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  decimal = Integer(value).to_s
</span><span class='line'>  puts "Class of decimal: #{decimal.class}"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Simulated:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.1.0 :001 &gt; decimal = Integer(400).to_s
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "400"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :002 &gt; decimal.class
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; String
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :003 &gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Looking back at our original six lines of code, the first one is understandable.  The next two, the ones with slice! and gsub! I&rsquo;m not so sure about.  The only thing I know for sure is that when we have a method with the bang character ! that means we are changing the value in place, it modifies the receiver.  Let&rsquo;s jump over these two lines of code for the moment.</p>

<p>The next two lines, the ones with the if condition, I understand.  What they are saying is that if decimal is empty (true), then set decimal equal to nil.  The same goes for leader, if leader is empty, set it to nil.  Methods that have a question mark ? should return a boolean &ndash; either true or false.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  decimal = nil if decimal.empty?
</span><span class='line'>  leader  = nil if leader.empty?</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The last line of code in this method is bringing our data together, formatting the number to use a comma after the value of leader if we have a value in decimal as well.</p>

<p>Ok, so we nailed down the first line of the method and the last three.  Now what is going on in lines two and three?</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  #...
</span><span class='line'>  leader  = decimal.slice!(0, decimal.length % 3)
</span><span class='line'>  decimal.gsub!(/\d{3}(?!$)/,'\0,')</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It looks like we are trying to set a value of something to the leader variable by performing some actions on the decimal variable.  In the above code we are passing a starting position of 0 to the slice! method and an ending postion of decimal.length % 3.  Let&rsquo;s try this out using irb:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.1.0 :011 &gt; decimal = Integer(6234).to_s
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "6234"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :012 &gt; decimal.length % 3
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; 1
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :013 &gt; decimal.slice!(0,1)
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "6"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :014 &gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>From the example above, leader would be set to a value of &ldquo;6&rdquo;.  Let&rsquo;s try another example using a smaller number:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.1.0 :016 &gt; decimal = Integer(49).to_s
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "49"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :017 &gt; decimal.length % 3
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; 2
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :018 &gt; decimal.slice!(0,2)
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "49"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :019 &gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What the heck, let&rsquo;s throw one more example, this time using a bigger number:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.1.0 :019 &gt; decimal = Integer(1032578).to_s
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "1032578"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :020 &gt; decimal.length % 3
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; 1
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :021 &gt; decimal.slice!(0,1)
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "1"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :022 &gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Seems like this is making sense.  Lets put one more example up, this time tying things together so we can see both decimal and leader:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.1.0 :001 &gt; decimal = Integer(4794).to_s
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "4794"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :002 &gt; decimal.length
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; 4
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :003 &gt; decimal.length % 3
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; 1
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :004 &gt; leader = decimal.slice!(0,1)
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "4"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :005 &gt; decimal
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "794"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :006 &gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Ah!  So we now have leader set to &ldquo;4&rdquo; and decimal has been sliced down to &ldquo;794&rdquo;.  Recall that the method name is pretty_int and the purpose of this method is to make numbers look pretty.  In other words, we want our numbers to have commas where appropriate.  So in the example of submitting 4794, we want our method to return a value of 4,794.  If our submitted number is smaller, we don&rsquo;t need the comma, and if the number is larger, say 1032578, we would like it to be formatted as:  1,032,578.</p>

<p>We are almost there &ndash; just need to figure out how that other line of code works.  We can have a safe assumption that gsub will do a substitution.  But exactly how is this code suppose to work.  Lets look at it again:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  decimal.gsub!(/\d{3}(?!$)/,'\0,')</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&rsquo;s drop back into irb and see if we can make some sense of this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.1.0 :001 &gt; decimal = Integer(4793).to_s
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "4793"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :002 &gt; leader = decimal.slice!(0, decimal.length % 3)
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "4"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :003 &gt; decimal.gsub!(/\d{3}(?!$)/,'\0,')

</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :006 &gt; [leader,decimal].compact.join(",")

</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :007 &gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I have a basic understanding of what is going on, but I&rsquo;m still not very comfortable with Regular Expressions, which is what we are passing to the slice! method above.  How about another example?</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.1.0 :007 &gt; decimal = Integer(1249580).to_s
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "1249580"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :008 &gt; leader = decimal.slice!(0, decimal.length % 3)
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "1"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :009 &gt; decimal.gsub!(/\d{3}(?!$)/,'\0,')
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "249,580"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :010 &gt; [leader,decimal].compact.join(",")
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "1,249,580"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :011 &gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Think I&rsquo;m almost there with my understanding.  I&rsquo;m going to take a look at one more example using irb:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.1.0 :011 &gt; decimal = Integer(56752).to_s
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "56752"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :012 &gt; leader = decimal.slice!(0, decimal.length % 3)
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "56"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :013 &gt; decimal.gsub!(/\d{3}(?!$)/,'\0,')
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; nil
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :014 &gt; decimal
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "752"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :015 &gt; leader
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "56"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :016 &gt; [leader,decimal].compact.join(",")
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "56,752"
</span><span class='line'>2.1.0 :017 &gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once the slice! operation has completed, we have part of our number stored in leader and the remainder in decimal.  For every group of more than 3 numbers in decimal, we will do a substitution and insert a comma.  I know what is happening, but I&rsquo;m still having a hard time properly describing what is going on, and how it knows where to place the commas.  I&rsquo;ll need to bone up on RegEx!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across this tip while reading the book <em>&ldquo;Build Awesome Command-Line Applications
in Ruby 2,&rdquo;</em> by David Bryant Copeland.  Although most of the code I&rsquo;ve been practicing
has been Ruby on Rails, at my day job we utilize a lot of command line applications.  I&rsquo;m on a mission to add Ruby to our toolbox which currently is Perl and shell scripts.</p>

<p>For a recent project I needed a command line application that could take a CSV
file as an input, extract out some data, and create a new pipe (|) delimted text
file.  I use RVM on my personal laptop and desktop, so I installed it on our
company server.  At that time, Ruby was at version 1.93.  Not too long after, I
added 2.0.0 and 2.1.0.  But my application was written in 1.93.  It is a simple
application so the version shouldn&rsquo;t matter.  But in case it does, you may find
value in this tip.</p>

<p>If you are a RVM user, and type the command &lsquo;which ruby&rsquo; at the command line, you
may get something similar to:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>/Users/jfhogarty/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.0/bin/ruby</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can use that as the first line of your ruby script:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#!/Users/jfhogarty/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.0/bin/ruby</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, if you want your script to use whatever the current version of Ruby is,
or if Ruby is in a different location on a machine other than yours, you can use this syntax:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This tip is found on page 4, in the section: &ldquo;Shebang: How the Systems Knows an App Is A Ruby Script&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my quest for knowledge, I&rsquo;ve come across a myraid of good online resources.  In today&rsquo;s blog I will share with you what sites I have found to be useful &ndash; some are free and some are not.</p>

<p>After struggling a bit in my pursuit of creating my idea using the Zend PHP framework, I bumped into a guy, Shay, who pointed me in the direction of Rails.  I remember clearly two sites he told me to check out:</p>

<p><a href="http://railscasts.com">http://railscasts.com</a> and <a href="http://tryruby.org">http://tryruby.org</a></p>

<p>Upon completing the tryruby online course I believe it suggested that I visit the site:  <a href="http://railsforzombies.org.">http://railsforzombies.org.</a>  Both the tryruby.org and railsforzombies.org sites are products of <a href="http://codeschool.com.">http://codeschool.com.</a>  Code School has both free and pay-for content.  After completing their free courses, and viewing some of the free episodes of Code TV, I signed up for a yearly membership.</p>

<p>Another site I ran into was <a href="https://peepcode.com/.">https://peepcode.com/.</a>  I liked what I saw with some of their free episodes and I signed up for a year membership.  Shortly after, Peep Code was picked up by Plural Sight and my membership was transferred at no additional cost.  This was a great deal!  I got access to everything I had previously at Peep Code, plus a ton of new great content at Plural Sight.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also viewed some of the free content at <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/.">http://teamtreehouse.com/.</a>  I like what I have seen so far, but have not yet signed up for their service.  They are a bit more pricey than Code School and Plural Sight.  Part of the reason I&rsquo;m holding off with Treehouse is because I&rsquo;m seriously considering a boot camp.</p>

<p>Boot Camps &ndash; There are both physical and online boot camps available.  I work full time and don&rsquo;t really want to travel to New York or San Francisco at this time.  So in my search of online education, I&rsquo;ve narrowed down three that look promising &ndash; <a href="http://bloc.io,">http://bloc.io,</a> <a href="http://gotealeaf.com">http://gotealeaf.com</a> and <a href="http://thinkful.com.">http://thinkful.com.</a>  So far bloc.io is my first choice, but I need to reach out to Tea Leaf Academy for more information.</p>

<p>Wrapping up, I want to share a few more resources.  Although these are not directly related to Ruby or Rails, they do fit in with expanding ones education in programming.  First, I really want to get better with Vim and you can watch free screencasts on vim over at: <a href="http://vimcasts.org/">http://vimcasts.org/</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still not very comfortable around JavaScript and CoffeeScript so I like these two sites:  <a href="http://coffeescript.org">http://coffeescript.org</a> and <a href="http://jsforcats.com/">http://jsforcats.com/</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Welcome to my blog.  I&rsquo;m just an old guy that is trying to learn new tricks every day.  Well, I&rsquo;m an old guy in the sense that my daughter came up to me one day and asked if I had used quills to write with when I was in school.  Though I did use a quill in art class it wasn&rsquo;t because that is all we had &ndash; it was just to illustrate how the tool worked.</p>

<p>There is a saying along the lines of <em>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t teach an old dog new tricks.&rdquo;</em>  I don&rsquo;t really believe this and I thought I&rsquo;d twist the words a bit and use it as a catchy domain name, thus &ndash; OldGuyNewTrick.com</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t consider myself old as a mid-forties guy, but for keeping with the fun, I&rsquo;ll play the role of an old guy and the context of a &lsquo;trick&rsquo; is me learning how to code in Ruby and Rails.  Well actually web development in general, but the focus is on Ruby and Rails.</p>

<p>I will leverage this blog to document my journey and share my experiences.  Years ago I had toyed with blogs and tools like WordPress.  I really hadn&rsquo;t given any thought to starting a new blog until I heard several well known people in the Ruby community, for example Ben Orenstein, suggest that if one is a programmer, they should have a blog.</p>

<p>Will anyone ever read this?  Why have a blog?  At first I disagreed with them and wasn&rsquo;t going to do it.  But it was like the universe was talking to me.  The topic of having a blog kept coming up in conversations, podcasts, and screencasts.  And I had a thought &ndash; even if no one reads this but me, it will still be useful.  By writing down my experiences I will have a good reference to look back on.  I may figure out a solution to a problem this week, and have a similar one a year from now.  But being an old guy, I may not remember, so I can refer back to this blog.</p>

<p>I am not well known in the programming community, but I plan on making a dent in the community.  On twitter and github I go by hogihung.  I wouldn&rsquo;t get all giddy and jump over to GitHub to see what I&rsquo;ve done &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be disappointed.  Remeber, I&rsquo;m new at this.  All I have is learning demos up there at the moment.</p>

<p>Ho Gi Hung is my Chinese name and I tend to use it as my internet persona.  My given name is John F. Hogarty, glad to meet you.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/avatar_jh.jpg" width="80" alt="My Avatar" /></p>

<p>One last item to note &ndash; this blog is created using Octopress and hosted on GitHub.  I&rsquo;m still learning how all this works, so please bear with me as I work out the kinks.  :)</p>
