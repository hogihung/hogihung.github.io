    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I covered a topic that resurfaced while I am in the process of upgrading one of our apps from Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.x. When I wrote that application I was a raw recruit &ndash; fresh to Ruby and Rails and just trying to get the idea to work.</p>

<p>But as I&rsquo;ve been improving my skills and expanding the ole grey matter, I wanted to write this new version, fully tested.  In the application there is a need to be able to export the data to a CSV formatted file.  I had the code from the old version of the app, and migrated it over.  However, I challenged myself to figure out how to write a test for the to_csv method in Baytech model.</p>

<p>Below is the code from the Baytech model:</p>

<p>```
def self.to_csv
  CSV.generate(col_sep: &lsquo;:&rsquo;) do |csv|</p>

<pre><code>all.each do |baytech|
  port = "X"
  csv &lt;&lt; [baytech.name, baytech.phone_num, baytech.ip_addr, port, baytech.modem_type, port]
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>I know the method works, as it has been working fine for 9 months or so now.  But I really wanted to figure out how to write a test for this method.  After much trial and error, along with research via books and google, I came up with the following solution:</p>

<p>```
describe Baytech, &lsquo;#to_csv&rsquo; do
  let(:baytech) { FactoryGirl.create(:baytech) }</p>

<p>  before do</p>

<pre><code>baytech
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  it { expect(Baytech.to_csv).to match /#{baytech.name}:#{baytech.phone_num}:#{baytech.ip_addr}:X:1:X/ }
end
```</p>

<p>You may notice in the above code that I am referencing a Factory.  Here is a short version of that factory file:</p>

<p>```
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :baytech do</p>

<pre><code>sequence(:name) {|n| "jaxfl0#{n}b9" }
sequence(:ip_addr) {|n| "10.1.2.#{n}" }
phone_num "7091234384"
region "USA"
modem_type "1"
ip_method "ssh"
active true
has_modem_line true
updated_by "cd1234"

{-snip-}
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The keen eye may have caught something interesting in the to_csv method.  I&rsquo;m using an option, col_sep: &lsquo;:&rsquo; which allows me to use the : character as the delimiter instead of the default comma.</p>

<p>With the test in place, and passing, I felt better about the code in my to_csv method.</p>
