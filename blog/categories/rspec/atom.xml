    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my previous <a href="http://oldguynewtrick.com/blog/2015/02/03/gathering-of-some-newbs/">post</a> I spoke about the Flex Blogger project.  Josh introduced us to a new component called ckeditor.  Ckeditor is a javascript based gui text editor.  After using ckeditor I thought it would be beneficial to add it to another application I created for my day job &ndash; HarePD.</p>

<p>Before starting on new features, I will fire off my test suite to make sure everything is still green.  For me I just type:  rspec</p>

<p>I love seeing all that green!  Next, I created a branch to work on this new feature, and updated my Gemfile:</p>

<p>```
git checkout -b add_ckeditor
vim Gemfile</p>

<p>{added}
gem &lsquo;ckeditor&rsquo;
```</p>

<p>You can get more information regarding how to setup ckeditor in your rails application by visiting <a href="https://github.com/galetahub/ckeditor">here</a></p>

<p>With the new gem added, and minor updates made in the appropriate view file, _form.html.slim, it was time to re-run my test suite.  Things were looking good as I saw green, green, green.  Then, as my tests executed on the scenarios that used ckeditor, I started to see red.  No big deal I thought, probably a simple change.  Below is an example of one of my tests that was failing:</p>

<p>```
spec/support/issues_helper.rb</p>

<p>def create_issue
  click_link &lsquo;Add Issue&rsquo;
  fill_in &lsquo;Title&rsquo;, with: &lsquo;Cert Expiration&rsquo;
  fill_in &lsquo;Description&rsquo;, with: &lsquo;SSL Cert Expiration&rsquo;
  select(&lsquo;2&rsquo;, :from => &lsquo;User level&rsquo;)
  select(&lsquo;Linux&rsquo;, :from => &lsquo;Os&rsquo;)
  click_button &lsquo;Submit&rsquo;
end
```</p>

<p>Ok, this should be an easy fix.  I inspected the ckeditor element on my webpage using the Chrome Dev Tools, and got the new name &ndash; issue_description.  So I updated the tests that were using &lsquo;Description&rsquo; and replaced with &lsquo;issue_description.&rsquo;  I ran a focused test, on just one scenario and it went green.  Next, I ran all the tests in that particular spec file and again I had a combination of green and red.  Argh!  I took notice of all the failed tests and ran them each one-by-one.  They all passed &ndash; they were all green when executed on their own.  Argh f#@% damnit!</p>

<p>Many hours passed as well as changes here and there to try and get things working.  To keep this post fairly short, I&rsquo;m going to jump to the solution.  After some research and trying different solutions, I stumbled upon the following:</p>

<p>```
Create a new file:
spec/support/ckeditor_helper.rb</p>

<p>def fill_in_ckeditor(locator, params = {})
  locator = find(&lsquo;label&rsquo;, text: locator)[:for] if page.has_css?(&lsquo;label&rsquo;, text: locator)
  page.execute_script &lt;&lt;-SCRIPT</p>

<pre><code>  var ckeditor = CKEDITOR.instances.#{locator}
  ckeditor.setData('#{params[:with]}')
  ckeditor.focus()
  ckeditor.updateElement()
</code></pre>

<p>  SCRIPT
end
```</p>

<p>With the above in place, I refactored my create_issue method from above to read as follows:</p>

<p><code>
def create_issue
  click_link 'Add Issue'
  fill_in 'Title', with: 'Cert Expiration'
  fill_in_ckeditor 'Description', with: 'SSL Cert Expiration'
  select('2', :from =&gt; 'User level')
  select('Linux', :from =&gt; 'Os')
  click_button 'Submit'
end
</code></p>

<p>After making the above changes, I ran my tests for the single spec file and to my delight, everything was green.  Now the real moment of truth &ndash; run the entire test suite.  A smile slowly expanded on my face as all the green scrolled by without a single pixel of red!</p>

<p>Although this issue aggravated me for a bit, the end result was much happiness and joy.  Not to mention I learned a few cool new things here and there in the process.</p>
