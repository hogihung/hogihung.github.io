    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While working on a Rails project last week I encountered an issue where some of my tests were failing.  It had been a while since I worked on this project so I had to re-familiarize myself with what was going on.</p>

<p>The tests were failing when editing a profile and adding an image.  I popped over to the browser and performed a manual test to get a better idea of what was going on.  That is when I saw the following error: <em>&ldquo;Paperclip::Errors::NotIdentifiedByImageMagickError&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>To attempt to fix the issue, I first performed a simple uninstall and re-install of imagemagic using homebrew:</p>

<p><code>
brew uninstall imagemagick
brew install imagemagick
</code></p>

<p>This didn&rsquo;t solve the problem.  Imagemagic has a command line utility, convert, which one can use to see if the application is working.  I tried a simple test:</p>

<p><code>
convert moonie.jpg moon.png
</code></p>

<p>But I continued to get errors even with that simple test.  So off to the internet for some deep research.  I came across the following steps, which solved the issue I was having.</p>

<p>```
brew update
brew doctor
brew uninstall libtool
brew uninstall imagemagic</p>

<p>cd /Library/Caches/Homebrew
rm imagemag*
rm libtool-2.4.2.tar.gz</p>

<p>brew doctor
brew install libtool &mdash;universal
brew link libool &mdash;force
brew install imagemagic &mdash;build-from-source
```</p>

<p>After completing the above steps, the command line tool, convert was successful.  I re-tested the Rails application, both manually, and via my test suite, and all was green again.</p>
