    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most of my Rails projects, for personal use and education, have been using Postgresql or SQLite for the datbase backend.  At work our primary database is Oracle with a dash of MySQL.  Recently we decided to use MySQL with all future development, and migrate our tools/applications that use Oracle to use MySQL.</p>

<p>I downloaded and installed MySQL by grabbing the installer from the MySQL website:  <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/</a> and getting the version for my operating system &ndash; OS X Mavericks.</p>

<p>However, with this version installed I was having issues with bundler and getting the mysql gem to compile.  I tried a few solutions that I found on the internet, but none of them were working.</p>

<p>I found some other people who had issues, when using OSX Mavericks, with the MySQL installer.  They solved the issue by removing MySQL that was installed from the download via dev.mysql.com and then re-installing using Homebrew.</p>

<p>This solution worked for me as well.  I found this a bit odd, because earlier in the year I had issues with installing Postgres via Homebrew.  The solution for Postgres was to remove the Homebrew installation and use the installer from the Postgres site.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While working on a Rails project last week I encountered an issue where some of my tests were failing.  It had been a while since I worked on this project so I had to re-familiarize myself with what was going on.</p>

<p>The tests were failing when editing a profile and adding an image.  I popped over to the browser and performed a manual test to get a better idea of what was going on.  That is when I saw the following error: <em>&ldquo;Paperclip::Errors::NotIdentifiedByImageMagickError&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>To attempt to fix the issue, I first performed a simple uninstall and re-install of imagemagic using homebrew:</p>

<p><code>
brew uninstall imagemagick
brew install imagemagick
</code></p>

<p>This didn&rsquo;t solve the problem.  Imagemagic has a command line utility, convert, which one can use to see if the application is working.  I tried a simple test:</p>

<p><code>
convert moonie.jpg moon.png
</code></p>

<p>But I continued to get errors even with that simple test.  So off to the internet for some deep research.  I came across the following steps, which solved the issue I was having.</p>

<p>```
brew update
brew doctor
brew uninstall libtool
brew uninstall imagemagic</p>

<p>cd /Library/Caches/Homebrew
rm imagemag*
rm libtool-2.4.2.tar.gz</p>

<p>brew doctor
brew install libtool &mdash;universal
brew link libool &mdash;force
brew install imagemagic &mdash;build-from-source
```</p>

<p>After completing the above steps, the command line tool, convert was successful.  I re-tested the Rails application, both manually, and via my test suite, and all was green again.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/testing-to-csv-method/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-23T09:32:37-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/testing-to-csv-method</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I covered a topic that resurfaced while I am in the process of upgrading one of our apps from Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.x. When I wrote that application I was a raw recruit &ndash; fresh to Ruby and Rails and just trying to get the idea to work.</p>

<p>But as I&rsquo;ve been improving my skills and expanding the ole grey matter, I wanted to write this new version, fully tested.  In the application there is a need to be able to export the data to a CSV formatted file.  I had the code from the old version of the app, and migrated it over.  However, I challenged myself to figure out how to write a test for the to_csv method in Baytech model.</p>

<p>Below is the code from the Baytech model:</p>

<p>```
def self.to_csv
  CSV.generate(col_sep: &lsquo;:&rsquo;) do |csv|</p>

<pre><code>all.each do |baytech|
  port = "X"
  csv &lt;&lt; [baytech.name, baytech.phone_num, baytech.ip_addr, port, baytech.modem_type, port]
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>I know the method works, as it has been working fine for 9 months or so now.  But I really wanted to figure out how to write a test for this method.  After much trial and error, along with research via books and google, I came up with the following solution:</p>

<p>```
describe Baytech, &lsquo;#to_csv&rsquo; do
  let(:baytech) { FactoryGirl.create(:baytech) }</p>

<p>  before do</p>

<pre><code>baytech
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  it { expect(Baytech.to_csv).to match /#{baytech.name}:#{baytech.phone_num}:#{baytech.ip_addr}:X:1:X/ }
end
```</p>

<p>You may notice in the above code that I am referencing a Factory.  Here is a short version of that factory file:</p>

<p>```
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :baytech do</p>

<pre><code>sequence(:name) {|n| "jaxfl0#{n}b9" }
sequence(:ip_addr) {|n| "10.1.2.#{n}" }
phone_num "7091234384"
region "USA"
modem_type "1"
ip_method "ssh"
active true
has_modem_line true
updated_by "cd1234"

{-snip-}
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The keen eye may have caught something interesting in the to_csv method.  I&rsquo;m using an option, col_sep: &lsquo;:&rsquo; which allows me to use the : character as the delimiter instead of the default comma.</p>

<p>With the test in place, and passing, I felt better about the code in my to_csv method.</p>
