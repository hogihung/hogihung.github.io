    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I ran across this tip while reading the book <em>&ldquo;Build Awesome Command-Line Applications
in Ruby 2,&rdquo;</em> by David Bryant Copeland.  Although most of the code I&rsquo;ve been practicing
has been Ruby on Rails, at my day job we utilize a lot of command line applications.  I&rsquo;m on a mission to add Ruby to our toolbox which currently is Perl and shell scripts.</p>

<p>For a recent project I needed a command line application that could take a CSV
file as an input, extract out some data, and create a new pipe (|) delimted text
file.  I use RVM on my personal laptop and desktop, so I installed it on our
company server.  At that time, Ruby was at version 1.93.  Not too long after, I
added 2.0.0 and 2.1.0.  But my application was written in 1.93.  It is a simple
application so the version shouldn&rsquo;t matter.  But in case it does, you may find
value in this tip.</p>

<p>If you are a RVM user, and type the command &lsquo;which ruby&rsquo; at the command line, you
may get something similar to:</p>

<p><code>
/Users/jfhogarty/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.0/bin/ruby
</code></p>

<p>You can use that as the first line of your ruby script:
```</p>

<h1>!/Users/jfhogarty/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.0/bin/ruby</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>However, if you want your script to use whatever the current version of Ruby is,
or if Ruby is in a different location on a machine other than yours, you can use this syntax:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/env ruby</h1>

<p>```</p>
