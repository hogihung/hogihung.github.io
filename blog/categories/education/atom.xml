    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Day two was a rough start for me.  I over slept a little bit so I didn&rsquo;t have time to get breakfast at home.  Luckily, there was some breakfast provided at the conference.  I&rsquo;m not a big carb eater, but I knew that if I didn&rsquo;t eat something, it would be a rough day.  So down went a half bagel, some fruit, a glass of water and a coffee chaser.</p>

<p>Starting out the day was someone I had heard of, but never met &ndash; Terence Lee.  Terence works at Heroku as well as participates on the Ruby core team as a contributor.  I enjoyed this talk because I&rsquo;ve been using Heroku in my knowledge quest and found the topic to be relevant.  I think we sometimes take for granted what is going on behind the scenes, by guys like Terence, to ensure easy deployment of our apps.  In summary &ndash; make sure you are off of Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2.</p>

<p>For day two, I took the most notes during the second talk by Craig Kerstiens.  He talked about Postgres which is the primary database that I&rsquo;ve been using in my Rails applications.  Craig confirmed something that I had encountered two days earlier &ndash; don&rsquo;t use homebrew for Postgres.  Download and use the Postgres.app from their website.  I had a lot of issues during my workshop due to homebrew and its installation of Postgres.  Along with good tips for Postgres related resources, I also learned new stuff like sequential scan vs index scan.  And using Gin for indexing when you have multiple values in a column vs the standard BTree index method.  Rounding out his talk, I walked away with a to-do list of required research on HStore and jsonb.</p>

<p>Lunch on day two was the only part of the conference I didn&rsquo;t like.  I am not a pasta fan at all and sadly didn&rsquo;t find much I could eat.  I ended up snacking on two pieces of cheese and a chunk of bread.  Where the meal failed for me, the desert was a home run!  So I filled up on desert and coffee.  Yup, I was a bit jittery for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>After lunch it was time for Aaron.  His presentation had both a healthy serving of comedic relief as well as filling geekery.  Who else but Aaron would code a way, using a webcam, to scan all of his Magic the Gathering cards and catalog their value?  Oh and did I mention there were cats?  Aaron urged the audience to help him test out one of his projects related to OpenCV.  We were to all send him a tweet with the words &ldquo;Photo Me&rdquo;.  The goal was for his program to see the tweet, take a picture of Aaron at that moment in time, and send the picture to the person who tweeted him.  Well it seems one variable wasn&rsquo;t accounted for &ndash; Twitter.  With a flood of incoming requests to his Twitter account, the &ldquo;enforcers&rdquo; locked his account.</p>

<p>Something that I had forgotten to mention earlier was that for most of the conference, Ben sat with me.  I really thought this was cool.  Most of the speakers sat together up front or to the side.  But I got to sit with Ben &ndash; just me and him.</p>

<p>Which brings me to one of Ben&rsquo;s friends &ndash; Konstantin.  Ben had made some reference to Konstantin in his presentation &ndash; well more like to Konstantin&rsquo;s bag which apparently got lost while enroute to a conference in the Philippines.  Konstantin had a good bit of humor in his presentation which focused on security.  It was very englightening to learn about the many different ways hackers try to compromise web applications, including Rails applications.  Both the Ruby and Rails teams make a great effort to eliminate/prevent security issues.  I&rsquo;ll admit there were parts of the talk that went over my head.  But overall, I found it very usefull and an area where I want to learn more.</p>

<p>Near the end of Konstantin&rsquo;s talk I started to feel the effect of not eating a proper lunch, and an overload of sweets.  I started getting a little light-headed.  So the end of the conference was a bit of a blur.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been to two Ruby related conferences &ndash; Ruby Conf 2013 in Miami, and now this one, Ancient City Ruby Conf 2014.  Although the one if Miami was much larger, I enjoyed the Ancient City one more.  I felt like I learned more at ACR and fit in better.  At the conference in Miami I very much felt like an outsider.  But at ACR I met a lot of people from all over the US and the world.  I am looking forward to another Ancient City Ruby conference in 2015!</p>

    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/06/ancient-city-ruby-2014-day-one</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The actual conference was split across two days, and followed the single-track format.  This was unlike my experience at Ruby Conf 2013 &ndash; Miami, which was multiple topics going on concurrently.  For the first day, the following speakers were lined up:  Leon Gersing, Justin Searls, David Copeland, Katrina Owen, Richard Schneeman, and Ben Lovell.  Of all those speakers, I only had ever heard of three, and as it so happened, met each one of them: Justin Searls, Katrina Owen and Ben Lovell.</p>

<p>In a quick summary of the day, I wrote the most notes from the talk by Leon, learned the most from Katrina&rsquo;s talk and laughed my ass off, and learned some stuff, from Ben&rsquo;s talk.  Justin talk also had my interest and I had jotted down some notes from his presentation.</p>

<p>I really liked Leon&rsquo;s talk as to me it was not directly programming/developer related, but more so a spiritual and inspirational discussion.  I don&rsquo;t know if it was planned this way, but I believe it was perfectly executed as the first talk of the day &ndash; really set a good mood and environment.  Something that Leon said really moved me.  He said: &ldquo;Twitter, Facebook, Instagram are all simulations of relationships.&rdquo;  I thought that was very powerful.</p>

<p>Before I continue, I just want to say that I enjoyed all of the talks from the speakers on this day.  But given my current skill level with Ruby and as a programmer, some of the talks were more moving and relevant to me.  I&rsquo;m sure others had similar, but different results.</p>

<p>Three speakers in, some brief talks by some sponsors as well as lightening talks, and it was time for lunch.  I really enjoyed the lunch that was provided at the hotel for the conference.  Not only was the meal yummy, but the deserts were great as well.</p>

<p>On a nice full stomach, with a big smile on my face, it was time for Katrina&rsquo;s talk.  I really enjoy her presentation style and I feel that the delivery was at a level that I was able to absorb.  Katrina took us through a refactoring session for &ldquo;Bob.&rdquo;  Frightenly, some of that code looked familiar :)  If you get a chance, you can check out her prentation at: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kytrinyx/overkill">Overkill</a></p>

<p>Being the last speaker on a given day is a tough task.  People tend to start getting tired.  Leave it to Ben to fire up the crowd.  He had all of us rolling with laughter from his opening remarks to his closing arguments.  And along the way we learned a bit about testing APIs.  Watch out for those &ldquo;f#$@ing sharks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Day one didn&rsquo;t actually end after Ben&rsquo;s talk.  That evening some of the conference attendees went on the Ghost Ride, while the rest of us got to do the Pirate Ship adventure.  Even though I live in Jacksonville, which isn&rsquo;t too far from St. Augustine, I had not ever been on the Pirate Ship.  It was a lot of fun.  I just wish that I had my heavier hoodie and it got a bit cold on the water.  On the ship I got to meet a few other people from Hash Rocket, including Paul Elliott.  I had heard Paul&rsquo;s voice on several episodes of the Ruby5 podcast, and it was nice to meet him in person.</p>

<p>All-in-all, day one was a big hit for me.  Oh, I almost forgot!  At the beginning of the day, before the first talk started, I got to meet and shake hands with Aaron Patterson.  Yeah, you could say I&rsquo;m a fanboi of his.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/05/ancient-city-ruby-workshop/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-05T10:38:58-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/04/05/ancient-city-ruby-workshop</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my last post I discussed events prior to Ancient City Ruby 2014.  Now it is time to discuss my experience at the actual workshop and conference.  The conference part was spread across two days, Thursday and Friday, and there was an optional workshop day &ndash; Wednesday.  There were three different workshops offered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refactoring Rails by Katrina Owen</li>
<li>Rock@Vim by Jon Allured and Micah</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails: First Expedition by Beverly Nelson</li>
</ul>


<p>I had a tough decision to make.  I really wanted to attend Katrina&rsquo;s workshop, but I don&rsquo;t believe my skill set is good enough at this time to have been able to participate.  I thought that I&rsquo;d surely slow the class down.  On the other hand, I think I&rsquo;m beyond the Ruby on Rails: First Expedition level.  I am horrible at Vim, so it seemed obvious that I should sign up for the Rock@Vim workshop, and I did.</p>

<p>The Vim workshop was taught by two Hashrocket employees, Jon and Micah.  I&rsquo;d never met Jon before as he works out of the Chicago office.  But I have met Micah before, and he has helped me out a few times when I have gotten stuck or had questions.  Having some familiarity with a teacher was a plus.</p>

<p>I really wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect for the workshop, or how we would approach the topic.  I just want to get better at Vim.  Primarily, being better at vim would help at my day job as we ssh to most of our devices.  But I also want to try pair programming and from what I&rsquo;ve researched, one really needs to know vim.</p>

<p>The workshop started off good.  Jon and Micah introduced us to dotmatrix:</p>

<p><code>
git clone https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix.git
</code></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know all the ins and outs but I guess I would summarize it as saying that by using dotmatrix I was able to configure my environment to by more &ldquo;HashRocketey&rdquo;  From the README.md file:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dotmatrix is a collection of dotfiles used at Hashrocket to customize various development tools. This project is the culmination of many years worth of tinkering with our favorite tools to get them to behave just right. We think using dotmatrix makes working with these tools more pleasant and hope you will too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were a few steps involved to get everything up and running, but I won&rsquo;t bore you with those details.  After the class was all setup, or at least we thought we were setup, we moved on to cloning a practice Rails project which we were going to use in our lessons for vim.</p>

<p>During part of the lesson I experienced an issue.  For some reason I was getting hung up with some issues involving Postgres.  I started to fall behind the class as I was trouble shooting.  Finally I just asked &ndash; &ldquo;&hellip; can I switch this project to SQLite to get beyond these problems?&rdquo;  Jon agreed that would be a good idea.  So I switched and tried to catch up.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t going well for me.  Working with my Postgres issue caused me to miss some key instructions and details that the rest of the class had observed.  Instead of fighting to try to figure things out, I just sat back and tried to focus.  I guess Micah saw that I was having some trouble so he came over to assist.  When I explained my situation he helped to get me back on track and also has Jon show me some stuff that helped to get me caught up.</p>

<p>At about the time I got caught up, we were quickly coming upon lunch time.  There was only four of us students plus Jon and Micah.  So we all went out to lunch together at A1A Ale Works.  It was a good time.  The advantage of a small class enabled us to be able to get to know each other and see what each others experience was like.</p>

<p>After lunch we were back at the brain fillage.  I was starting to get a bit tired, and it seemed like the topics were getting harder.  But we pressed on and learned some more neat things with using vim.  I learned enough during the workshop to make me want to learn more.  I will continue my vim learning, using what I absorbed in the workshop as a foundation, and utilize other resources like Vim Genius (<a href="http://vimgenius.com/">http://vimgenius.com/</a>) and the cool screencast series Vimcasts (<a href="http://vimcasts.org/">http://vimcasts.org/</a>).  Also, I picked up a copy of &ldquo;Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought,&rdquo; by Drew Neil who also produces the vimcasts.</p>

<p>Although I had some tough, frustrating moments, overall I enjoyed the Vim workshop.  Whether Jon knew it or not, he gave me a homework assignment.  As I was practicing at home that evening, I noticed that my prompt in the terminal was really long.  I prefer the following format:</p>

<p><code>
jfhogarty@Serenity:(source+*-)$
</code></p>

<p>So I had to figure out how to fix my prompt.  It wasn&rsquo;t too hard, just an edit to my ~/.bashrc file.  In my next post I will review my experience of the first day of the conference.  Stay tuned.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/29/week-2-and-a-half-at-bloc/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-29T10:02:23-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/29/week-2-and-a-half-at-bloc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first week of my training at Bloc went by very fast. For the most part it was a review of information/knowledge I had already gained, but was still worth it.  I had wanted to create another blog post earlier, but the completion of the second block took longer than I had anticipated.</p>

<p>So here we are, about about 2.5 weeks in. The second block, titled Rails Foundation, should take one about 40 hours.  At least that is the estimated time for completion.  If I wasn&rsquo;t working full-time, maybe I could have completed this block in one week.</p>

<p>The Rails Foundation block is composed of 20 checkpoints.  We learned a lot of concepts, and habits in those checkpoints.  There was some review for me, for example the lesson introduced the Devise gem.  I&rsquo;ve played with this a little bit so had some comfort with that checkpoint.  Though I did learn some new things related to Devise.</p>

<p>A totally new experience for me was when did the Authorization checkpoint, and was introduced to the Pundit gem.  I would say that Pundit is a little bit like CanCan.  I&rsquo;ve dabbled with CanCan a little bit, but I find Pundit to be pretty good.  I&rsquo;ll have a tough choice to make when it comes time for my Capstone project.  Should I go with Pundit, or revist CanCan (or CanCanCan.)</p>

<p>Another topic that I found useful, because it helped me with a task at my day job, was the lesson on Seeding.  While our main environment at work is Perl, I&rsquo;m slowing trying to sneak in some Ruby and Rails.  Leveraging some of the knowledge gained in the Seeding lesson, I was able to expand on that knowledge and compose my first rake task for populating my models with data in CSV files.  Ok, I&rsquo;m a bit off topic, steer back John!</p>

<p>There were two area where my progress slowed to a crawl in the second block.  The first was related to uploading images.  Recently Bloc added a Rails 4.x track and it looks like some of the lesson code examples are missing.  I wasn&rsquo;t able to see my Choose File option for uploading an image.  A trip to the Chat Room and a small wait for my turn, and my issue was solved by Xander.  Xander is great!  Everytime I&rsquo;ve had a question, he seems to be in the chat room and helps me out.</p>

<p>The second area I had trouble with was nesting.  I&rsquo;ll admit that I&rsquo;m still 100% solid with what I&rsquo;ve learned about nesting, but I&rsquo;m confident things will become clearer as I see and utilize more code.  During one of the lessons related to this nesting of Topics, Posts and Comments, I got stuck real bad.  I went to the chat room for help, but it was just at the time for that shift to end for the day.  Xander stayed for a few minutes and helped a lot.  But I was still stuck.</p>

<p>I was worried that all the changes I had made may have broken something.  So I fired off an email to my mentor to let him know I was stuck and to be prepared for a nice long chat the next day when we were scheduled to meet.  We meet the next day and he helped get me fixed in less than 5 minutes.  My eyes were so focused around the code and didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;see&rdquo; the code.  I had several silly mistakes.  For example I used the plural version instead of singular for a particular item/method.  Or I had a misplaced period.  And other issue, I had the order of a ) and a period mixed up.  Simple things for the trained eye.  It was great to have the mentor there to help me through what I thought was a major <em>fsk</em> up on my part.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I made some more punctuation type mistakes on the remaing checkpoints in this block.  But since I suffered so much earlier in the block, I was much more aware of what to look for.  The hard part for me now is when I see an error message, and know basically what is wrong, I don&rsquo;t yet have the experience to provide the solution.  But I&rsquo;m eagerly working at improving my problem solution skills.  :)</p>

<p>As I write this post, again about 2.5, well maybe 2.75 weeks in, I&rsquo;m now on the third Block &ndash; Features / Testing / Javascript.  This block is also estimated to take 40 hours.  There are 10 checkpoints and I&rsquo;ve completed the first 4 so far.  But now I&rsquo;m really entering an area of unfamiliarity.  Upcoming in this block is RSpec and Ajax.  Two areas that have close to zero amount of knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for my next update.  This coming week I will be going to Ancient City Ruby so I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll have the time to complete the third block.  But once I have completed it, I will post my thoughts here.</p>

    <updated>2014-03-15T19:46:34-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/03/15/first-week-at-bloc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About two weeks ago I was trying to decide which on-line web developer education solution I would enroll in.  The decision was not easy.  Along with the weekly time requirements, roughly 25 hours per week, the financial cost is nothing to shrug off.  In the end I choose Bloc (<a href="http://www.bloc.io">http://www.bloc.io</a>)</p>

<p>My training at Bloc started this past Monday, March 10th.  The Bloc course runs about 12 weeks, broken down into four segments:</p>

<pre><code>1.  Environment Setup / Programming with Ruby
2.  Rails Foundation
3.  Features/Testing/Javascript
4.  Project Challenges
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just finished item 1 &ndash; Environment Setup / Programming with Ruby.  When I read the description of this section my first thought was, &ldquo;this should be easy.&rdquo;  I have been exploring Ruby and Rails for almost a year.  I&rsquo;ve installed RVM on several computers, worked with GitHub and Heroku, as well as several introductory tutorials.</p>

<p>And many of sub-sections in this first track were a nice and quick completion for me.  But, through each sub-section, I did learn something new.  For example, while working on setting up an app on Heroku, I learned how to add support for New Relic.  I&rsquo;ve seen ads and mention of New Relic a lot while learning Rails but never took a look at it.  Now I&rsquo;ve had a nice gentle introduction.</p>

<p>There are 20 sub-section to Environment Setup / Programming with Ruby.  I felt good and confident as I traversed through them one by one.  I was slowed down briefly in sub-section 14 &ndash; Arrays.  One of the exercises there introduced me to new code and techniques I had not yet experienced.  I love learning new stuff!</p>

<p>As I rounded out this section, I found myself staring at my nemesis &ndash; Blocks.  I don&rsquo;t know why, but I seem to have a mental <em>block</em> when it comes to Blocks (as well as Procs and Lambdas.)  This section took me a bit and I had to reach out for help.</p>

<p>In the Bloc program, each student has a mentor.  We have around 3 calls a week with our mentors.  When I got stuck it was after I had last talked with my mentor.  Not a problem &ndash; Bloc also has a staffed on-line chat room.  I popped in to the chat room and asked a question.  One of the staff there gave me a nudge.  After about 30 minutes I was still stuck.  I had gotten further, but still hadn&rsquo;t solved the problem.  Another question/discussion in the chat room and it became clear.  I was able to complete the lesson.  <strong>Happy Dance!</strong></p>

<p>I look forward to my next call with my mentor (tomorrow) and starting my next section &ndash; Rails Foundation.  As I progress through each section I&rsquo;ll return here to provide updates.</p>
