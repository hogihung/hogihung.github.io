    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While the focus, and majority of posts I plan on making, will revolve around the world of Ruby and web devlopement, my journey began with <em>&ldquo;Programming in Objective-C,&rdquo;</em> by Stephen G. Kochan.  While still persuing iOS and Objective-C knowledge, I also got <em>&ldquo;iOS Programming The Big Nerd Ranch Guide,&rdquo;</em> by Joe Conway &amp; Aaron Hillegass.  Shortly after I grabbed <em>&ldquo;Objective-C Programming The Big Nerd Ranch Guide,&rdquo;</em> by Aaron Hillegass.</p>

<p>Wadding through those books I quickly realized that I had a huge lack of knowledge, and though I really wanted to write iPhone apps, I needed to reboot and try a different approach.  I found an online course via iTunes-U which used the next book I purchased &ndash; <em>&ldquo;The Art &amp; Science of Java, An Introduction to Computer Science,&rdquo;</em> by Eric S. Roberts.  This book is used with the online course I subscribed to in iTunes, and by far the most expensive book I have purchased!  While reading that book, and following the course, I realized another gap in knowledge.  A lot of buzzwords were flying at me &ndash; OOP, Object Oriented Design, UML, Singleton, Design Patterns, etc.  So I did a little research on Amazon, and grabbed two new books by Head First &ndash; <em>&ldquo;Object-Oriented Analysis &amp; Design,&rdquo;</em> by McLaughlin, Pollice &amp; West and <em>&ldquo;Design Patterns,&rdquo;</em> by Freeman &amp; Freeman.  The Head First books used Java in their examples and I thought things were coming together. My Rails journey actually started because of <em>&ldquo;Object-Oriented Analysis &amp; Design&rdquo;</em> book.</p>

<p>Alrighty, lets now dive into the here and now.  My first Ruby/Rails book, and the one I would first suggest to anyone new to Rails, was <em>&ldquo;Ruby on Rails Tutorial,&rdquo;</em> by Michael Hartl.  This book won&rsquo;t be the end of your journey, but should give one enough to get a good understanding.  I plan on re-reading this book after I get through some others.  The next book I grabbed was probably way above my level, but I really enjoyed how this person thinks after watching some of her videos &ndash; <em>&ldquo;Practical Object-Oriented Design In Ruby,&rdquo;</em> by Sandi Metz.  Though a bit over my head for a good chunk of the book, I still found it very useful and I think I will understand more of what she wrote as I learn and experience more code.</p>

<p>The next book I got was <em>&ldquo;Agile Web Development with Rails 3.2,&rdquo;</em> by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hansson.  I found this to be very useful for filling in some gaps I had from the Rails Tuts book.  I happened to notice after I bought the book that a newer version would come out later in the year.  So I pre-ordered <em>&ldquo;Agile Web Development with Rails 4,&rdquo;</em> by the same trio.  I have not ready beyond the first chapter of this book yet.</p>

<p>One thing I was noticing from my reading experience of the two Rails books and the POODR book, I lacked some basic knowledge of the underlying language &ndash; Ruby.  So I grabbed <em>&ldquo;The Ruby Way,&rdquo;</em> by Hal Fulton.  I&rsquo;ve finished about half of the book and it cleared some things up for me.  I do use it as a reference from time-to-time and do want to get back into it for the second half.  Note I think this is the oldest of the Ruby/Rails books I have, so it isn&rsquo;t current.  But the majority of what you would read should still be relevant.</p>

<p>It might just be me, but I&rsquo;ve found that frequently I need information from multiple sources in order for me to understand certain topics.  So while <em>&ldquo;The Ruby Way&rdquo;</em> is very comprehensive, I picked up <em>&ldquo;The Ruby Programming Language,&rdquo;</em> by David Flanagan &amp; Yukikiro Matsumoto.  This book covered Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 so it was a little more up to date than the previous mentioned book.  Where as those first two book on Ruby will give you the meat of the language, I found this next book to be the sauce &ndash; <em>&ldquo;Eloquent Ruby,&rdquo;</em> by Russ Olsen.</p>

<p>I skipped a book, and in all honesty, I don&rsquo;t remember where in the order of books purchased that this one occurred.  I&rsquo;ve only read the first chapter and I like the book, but my mindset isn&rsquo;t ready for it.  I&rsquo;ll probably get virtually whipped for saying that, but I will revisit this book &ndash; <em>&ldquo;The RSpec Book,&rdquo;</em> by David Chelimsky.  For those new to Ruby and don&rsquo;t understand why I would be whipped, I&rsquo;ve found that the Ruby/Rails community is heavily into testing &ndash; BDD (behaviour driven-development) or TDD (test driven-devlopment).  I know this is an area I need to focus on!</p>

<p>Winding down there are a few more books.  I picked up the next book because I wanted more information on creating command line Ruby applications, so I purchased <em>&ldquo;Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby 2,&rdquo;</em> by David Bryant Copeland.  I really am enjoying this book and I&rsquo;m applying some of the things I&rsquo;ve learned to how I code work related stuff in Perl.</p>

<p>Although not directly related to Ruby or Rails, I picked up <em>&ldquo;The Little Book on CoffeeScript,&rdquo;</em> by Alex MacCaw.  They were not kidding, it is little!  I can&rsquo;t really say anything good about this book yet as I was disappointed at its size when it arrived.  I tossed it aside to read some other time &ndash; maybe on a rainy day.  The other non-directly related book I am enjoying is &ndash; <em>&ldquo;Practical Vim,&rdquo;</em> by Drew Neil.  I&rsquo;ve always admirred people who are awesome at the command line and in tools like Vim.  I&rsquo;m not one of them.  My preferred editor is Sublime Text, but I really want to learn Vim.  This book is good, and Drew produces some cool screencasts &ndash; <a href="http://vimcasts.org.">http://vimcasts.org.</a></p>

<p>Down to my last two physical books as of 2/19/2014 &ndash; <em>&ldquo;Ruby Under a Microscope,&rdquo;</em> by Pat Shaughnessy and <em>&ldquo;Seven Databases in Seven Weeks,&rdquo;</em> by Eric Redmond and Jim R. Wilson.  <em>&ldquo;Ruby Under a Microscope&rdquo;</em> is probably not a good fit for someone new to Ruby, but I&rsquo;m finding it absolutely enjoyable.  Sure there are things above my head, but I am able to digest most of the information and it actually helps me understand the language better.  I just received the Seven Databases book and haven&rsquo;t had a chance to read it yet.</p>

<p>All of the above are physical books I&rsquo;ve purchased in my persuit of learning to code.  I&rsquo;ve also purchases a few eBooks which I will list next.  I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of eBooks related to programming as I find the formatting tends to get screwed up when the authors try to show code blocks.  With that said, on my Kindle I have:  <em>&ldquo;Confident Ruby,&rdquo;</em> by Avdi Grimm, <em>&ldquo;Professional JavaScript for Web Developers,&rdquo;</em> by Nicholas C. Zakas, and <em>&ldquo;CoffeeScript Programming with jQuery, Rails and Node.js,&rdquo;</em> by Michael Erasmus.</p>

<p>There are two other books, and I wasn&rsquo;t going to inlude them, but just in case you want books on CakePHP or PHP Zend Framework, I strongly urge you TO STAY AWAY from: <em>&ldquo;Easy PHP Websites with The Zend Framework,&rdquo;</em> by W. Jason Gilmore, and <em>&ldquo;CakePHP 1.3 Application Development Cookbook,&rdquo;</em> by Mario Iglesias.  These two books are horrible!</p>

<h2>Apology</h2>

<p>When I first skechted out the list of books in my arsenal, it didn&rsquo;t look to be to long.  But as we can see from the above, when I wrapped words around the book names, this post got pretty long.  So I apologize for that.  I will make a great effort going forward to keep my posts shorter.  If needed, break up a long topic into multiple posts.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my quest for knowledge, I&rsquo;ve come across a myraid of good online resources.  In today&rsquo;s blog I will share with you what sites I have found to be useful &ndash; some are free and some are not.</p>

<p>After struggling a bit in my pursuit of creating my idea using the Zend PHP framework, I bumped into a guy, Shay, who pointed me in the direction of Rails.  I remember clearly two sites he told me to check out:</p>

<p><a href="http://railscasts.com">http://railscasts.com</a> and <a href="http://tryruby.org">http://tryruby.org</a></p>

<p>Upon completing the tryruby online course I believe it suggested that I visit the site:  <a href="http://railsforzombies.org.">http://railsforzombies.org.</a>  Both the tryruby.org and railsforzombies.org sites are products of <a href="http://codeschool.com.">http://codeschool.com.</a>  Code School has both free and pay-for content.  After completing their free courses, and viewing some of the free episodes of Code TV, I signed up for a yearly membership.</p>

<p>Another site I ran into was <a href="https://peepcode.com/.">https://peepcode.com/.</a>  I liked what I saw with some of their free episodes and I signed up for a year membership.  Shortly after, Peep Code was picked up by Plural Sight and my membership was transferred at no additional cost.  This was a great deal!  I got access to everything I had previously at Peep Code, plus a ton of new great content at Plural Sight.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also viewed some of the free content at <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/.">http://teamtreehouse.com/.</a>  I like what I have seen so far, but have not yet signed up for their service.  They are a bit more pricey than Code School and Plural Sight.  Part of the reason I&rsquo;m holding off with Treehouse is because I&rsquo;m seriously considering a boot camp.</p>

<p>Boot Camps &ndash; There are both physical and online boot camps available.  I work full time and don&rsquo;t really want to travel to New York or San Francisco at this time.  So in my search of online education, I&rsquo;ve narrowed down three that look promising &ndash; <a href="http://bloc.io,">http://bloc.io,</a> <a href="http://gotealeaf.com">http://gotealeaf.com</a> and <a href="http://thinkful.com.">http://thinkful.com.</a>  So far bloc.io is my first choice, but I need to reach out to Tea Leaf Academy for more information.</p>

<p>Wrapping up, I want to share a few more resources.  Although these are not directly related to Ruby or Rails, they do fit in with expanding ones education in programming.  First, I really want to get better with Vim and you can watch free screencasts on vim over at: <a href="http://vimcasts.org/">http://vimcasts.org/</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still not very comfortable around JavaScript and CoffeeScript so I like these two sites:  <a href="http://coffeescript.org">http://coffeescript.org</a> and <a href="http://jsforcats.com/">http://jsforcats.com/</a></p>
