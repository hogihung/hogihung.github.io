    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks back I was discussing an idea around the weekly Code and Coffee table.
The idea was a spin on something I saw Nathan Barry discussing over <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/24hours/">here</a>.
I still consider myself a newbie to Ruby, but I wanted to do my own personal hack-a-thon.</p>

<p>Well that idea morphed, or is the cool thing to say, pivoted, to a project that me
and two other new to Ruby programmers would work on. All three of us discussed the
idea of creating something new.  Something no one else has done before.  A blog
written in Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Hopefully now you are not looking at your screen with coffee sprayed all over it
due to your laughing.  I know, there have been many, many Blog type projects.  So
why is this one different?  I&rsquo;m not sure it really is.  What I can say is that
project is giving us an opportunity to work together and learn from each other.
Not to say anything bad about you seniors out there, but there are times I feel
that the best way to illustrate that I&rsquo;ve learned something that you have passed
on, is to share that knowledge with others around my level.</p>

<p>So yes, we are making a dynamic blog written in Rails.  If you are interested in
checking it out, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/hogihung/flex_blogger">here</a>.
Please keep in mind that we are still in active development.  I will update the
README file once we are at a point where we think the application is solid.</p>

<p>There are a lot of &lsquo;firsts&rsquo; for me in regards to this project.  This is the first
web application I&rsquo;m working on with more than two people actively working at the
same time.  I&rsquo;m learning how to create and manage pull requests.  I&rsquo;m attempting
to help lead the project and keep all of us updated on the progress.</p>

<p>All three of us have been working with Ruby and Rails for a little bit &ndash; perhaps
a year or year and half.  But there are some other &lsquo;new to us&rsquo; components that we
have choosen to try out.  We decided to bypass Devise and Twitter Bootstrap &ndash; both
things that were comfortable to us.  Instead, we are using several great tools
that <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/">Thoughtbot</a> has shared with the community
including:  Bourbon, Neat, Bitters, Refills, Clearance, FactoryGirl and HoundCI.</p>

<p>I welcome any feedback on our project, <strong>Flex Blogger</strong>.  Just shoot me a tweet on
Twitter, or email me.  I&rsquo;m excited to see the final product and have this cool
experience.</p>

<p>I still want to test my skills by doing a personal hack-a-thon, but I need to
convince some of the gurus I know to be my guest drop ins.  :)</p>

    <updated>2014-11-17T20:40:47-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/11/17/Cha-Cha-Cha-Chruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I got a bug, ney rather an itch I needed to scratch.  I have been using RVM for over a year and half.  I have had some issues, but mostly those were due to me learning how to work with RVM.</p>

<p>I was having an odd issue on one of my Macs so I decided to remove RVM and install rbenv.  I shot a tweet out to see if anyone had an opinion about rbenv and I received a reply suggesting I give chruby a chance.  Recently I had listened to an episode of Ruby Rogues <a href="http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/169-rr-version-managers-with-michal-papis-mislav-maronic-and-postmodern-mod-iii">#169</a>,  where they talked about RVM, rbenv, and chruby.</p>

<p>So I decied to give chruby a try.  Removing RVM is pretty straight forward.  You should be able to simply run:</p>

<p><code>
rvm implode
</code></p>

<p>Once removed, you may need to edit your .bashrc/.zshrc or *profile file(s) to remove any reference to RVM.</p>

<p>While I really like RVM, I&rsquo;ve always been a bit worried about the magic it performs &ndash; the stuff it does for me that I&rsquo;m not familiar with.  Chruby seemed to be easier for me to grasp.  From my limited understanding, there seems to be less moving parts in chruby vs. RVM.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to lay out all of the steps to get chruby installed.  The source web pages for chruby and ruby-install are very easy to read and comprehend.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby">chruby</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install">ruby-install</a></p>

<p>It took me a little bit to understand the differences of chruby and how I would use in my environment.  But after getting it running on my laptop, I converted two other Macs, my Ubuntu VM, and my CentOS server to use chruby.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, I do like RVM, and it had served me well.  I still use RVM at my day job on our CentOS servers.  I thought changing from RVM to chruby on those servers would be a good idea, so I attempted to change a development server.  While the removal of RVM and install of Chruby went fine, I ran into a huge issue.  I could not get Passenger to work properly under Chruby.  I&rsquo;m sure the reason is due to my lack of understanding, but I just couldn&rsquo;t afford to figure it out. So I switched back to RVM &ndash; and RVM will stay on our work servers.</p>

    <updated>2014-11-04T07:20:45-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/11/04/borrow-a-tapa-convention</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have many learning tools in my arsenal including Code School, Thoughtbot/Upcase, RailsCasts, Ruby Tapas, and too many other Internet based free resources to list.  But today I want to talk tapas, and borrow something that I learned from watching many episodes of Ruby Tapas.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve watched various episodes, I kept saying to myself, how is Avdi executing code right from within his text editor?  Is this some time of post production trickery?  Perhaps a green screen based laptop with a dash of After Effects?  But after some research, I learned that is wasn&rsquo;t some fancy magic, but rather an ability within his editor.  I believe that editor to be Emacs.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a Sublime Text user, and slowly dabbling with Vim.  So off to the online oracles to see if I could find a solution that would work in Sublime.  I did indeed find some solutions that said they were doing what Avdi can do &ndash; even referencing that they had the same desire as me.  However, I was not successful with getting Sublime to work the way I was expecting.  After spending several hours trying to force it to work, I gave up.  And I had a thought &ndash; surely this would be easier to get working with Vim.  :)</p>

<p>Getting the Tapas style in-line Ruby code execution to work in Vim was nice and easy.  I followed the instructions <a href="http://commandercoriander.net/blog/2012/10/10/evaluate-lines-of-ruby-in-vim/">here</a> and was up in running with very little effort.  For those that don&rsquo;t want leave from this fabulous reading, I&rsquo;ll summarize what needs to be done, first starting with the installation of a gem:</p>

<p><code>
gem install rcodetools
</code></p>

<p>Now we need to add a plugin to Vim.  Depending on your setup, you may need to add the .vim/bundle directory in your home directory.  But I already had this setup, so all I needed to do was the following:</p>

<p><code>
cd ~
cd .vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/t9md/vim-ruby-xmpfilter.git
</code></p>

<p>For a final bit of setup/configuration, we need to take a trip in editing the ~/.vimrc or ~/.vimrc.local file so we can do some mapping:</p>

<p>```
nmap <buffer> <F4> <Plug>(xmpfilter-mark)
xmap <buffer> <F4> <Plug>(xmpfilter-mark)
imap <buffer> <F4> <Plug>(xmpfilter-mark)</p>

<p>nmap <buffer> <F5> <Plug>(xmpfilter-run)
xmap <buffer> <F5> <Plug>(xmpfilter-run)
imap <buffer> <F5> <Plug>(xmpfilter-run)
```</p>

<p>The above mapping will allows us to mark (F4) what line(s) we want to see the results for of executing the ruby code, which we accomplish by pressing F5.  Let&rsquo;s step through an example to see how this works.  I&rsquo;ll show the example file through the various stages.</p>

<p><code>
1 class Person
2   attr_accessor :name, :age
3
4   def initialize(name)
5     self.name = name
6     self.age = "Does it matter?"
7   end
8 end
9
10 p = Person.new('Kevin')
11 p.name
12 p.age
</code></p>

<p>Next we will press F4 for the code we want to evaluate, line 11 below:</p>

<p><code>
1 class Person
2   attr_accessor :name, :age
3
4   def initialize(name)
5     self.name = name
6     self.age = "Does it matter?"
7   end
8 end
9
10 p = Person.new('Kevin')
11 p.name # =&gt;
12 p.age
</code></p>

<p>And finally, EXECUTE (F5):</p>

<p><code>
1 class Person
2   attr_accessor :name, :age
3
4   def initialize(name)
5     self.name = name
6     self.age = "Does it matter?"
7   end
8 end
9
10 p = Person.new('Kevin')
11 p.name # =&gt; "Kevin"
12 p.age
</code></p>

<p>Pretty neat, eh?  Borrowing this workflow from Ruby Tapas will now help me when I&rsquo;m following along with each episode.  Now I just need to get better with Vim.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Testing to_csv Method]]></title>
    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/testing-to-csv-method/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-23T09:32:37-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/testing-to-csv-method</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I covered a topic that resurfaced while I am in the process of upgrading one of our apps from Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.x. When I wrote that application I was a raw recruit &ndash; fresh to Ruby and Rails and just trying to get the idea to work.</p>

<p>But as I&rsquo;ve been improving my skills and expanding the ole grey matter, I wanted to write this new version, fully tested.  In the application there is a need to be able to export the data to a CSV formatted file.  I had the code from the old version of the app, and migrated it over.  However, I challenged myself to figure out how to write a test for the to_csv method in Baytech model.</p>

<p>Below is the code from the Baytech model:</p>

<p>```
def self.to_csv
  CSV.generate(col_sep: &lsquo;:&rsquo;) do |csv|</p>

<pre><code>all.each do |baytech|
  port = "X"
  csv &lt;&lt; [baytech.name, baytech.phone_num, baytech.ip_addr, port, baytech.modem_type, port]
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>I know the method works, as it has been working fine for 9 months or so now.  But I really wanted to figure out how to write a test for this method.  After much trial and error, along with research via books and google, I came up with the following solution:</p>

<p>```
describe Baytech, &lsquo;#to_csv&rsquo; do
  let(:baytech) { FactoryGirl.create(:baytech) }</p>

<p>  before do</p>

<pre><code>baytech
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  it { expect(Baytech.to_csv).to match /#{baytech.name}:#{baytech.phone_num}:#{baytech.ip_addr}:X:1:X/ }
end
```</p>

<p>You may notice in the above code that I am referencing a Factory.  Here is a short version of that factory file:</p>

<p>```
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :baytech do</p>

<pre><code>sequence(:name) {|n| "jaxfl0#{n}b9" }
sequence(:ip_addr) {|n| "10.1.2.#{n}" }
phone_num "7091234384"
region "USA"
modem_type "1"
ip_method "ssh"
active true
has_modem_line true
updated_by "cd1234"

{-snip-}
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The keen eye may have caught something interesting in the to_csv method.  I&rsquo;m using an option, col_sep: &lsquo;:&rsquo; which allows me to use the : character as the delimiter instead of the default comma.</p>

<p>With the test in place, and passing, I felt better about the code in my to_csv method.</p>

    <link href="http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/07/24/wrap-up-bloc/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-24T12:05:14-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://hogihung.github.io/blog/2014/07/24/wrap-up-bloc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been bad.  I let myself get consumed by my attendance of the on-line course at Bloc, and spending a lot of after-work-hours working on my personal project.  I have neglected my writing, and I apologize for my absence.</p>

<p>Earlier today I received notification from Disquis that someone, Nalani, had submitted a comment.  I am grateful for that comment as it reminded me of absence from this blog.  So with that nice kick-in-the-pants, let&rsquo;s move forward.</p>

<p>I completed my on-line training of the Bloc.io course on June 9th 2014.  Overall I was satisfied with the training and can confidently recommend it to others, depending on their situation.  What?</p>

<p>Bloc is not for everyone.  The first barrier to overcome is the cost.  I believe I got in before the price increase so the tuition was around $4250 if memory serves me correctly.  I believe the price to be fair for what you get.  However, I would not suggest that anyone plop down that money if they are currently struggling financially.</p>

<p>Depending on your employment needs, Bloc may not be for you.  For me, I took the course to better my programming skills and to assist me move forward with my personal project.  But I would not say that what I learned would allow me to get a job similar to what I have now, at my current pay rate.  I think the education would help one land a junior-developer job or an internship at a dev shop.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert, but from my experience with local dev shops here, there is a heavy emphasis on testing and Test-Drive-Development(TDD.)  And when I took the Bloc course, that area was lacking.  You can see my previous post for more information.</p>

<p>Yesterday I received an email from Bloc that indicated that they improving the Full Stack program by adding more testing to the course.  Not sure if it was my feedback, or feedback from many of us past students, but I&rsquo;m glad to see that they continuously improve on their product.</p>

<p>Is Bloc for you?  Maybe.  If you are like me, someone who has a day job and wanted to improve their programming skills, while trying to bring your product idea to life, then yes.  Maybe you are someone with a great idea, a founder, and want to get a better grip on what it will take to produce your product.  I think Bloc can help you there.  If you are trying to break ground in the industry and land your first job or internship, then yes, I think Bloc is for you.  If you need the extra hand holding while learning the basics, then yes I think you will get value from the Bloc program.</p>

<p>I do want to end with a note about the mentorship, and you may have read into my words at the end of the last paragraph.  If you are seeking what I consider advance knowledge and/or assistance, you may be dissapointed.  While I found the mentorship to be very helpful at the beginning and middle of my training, I was dissapointed at the end when it came to my capstone project.  Fortunately for me, about 8 weeks in to my Bloc training, I met a guy, Shaun, who became my &lsquo;external-mentor.&rsquo;  If not for him, I would not have been able to complete some of the Bloc assignments the way I wanted &ndash; via TDD.  Sure I could have completed them, but I want to develop by writing tests first.  Shaun has also helped me with my personal project and taken it so much farther than I could have done on my own.  What I&rsquo;m trying to end with is this &ndash; no matter if you take the training at Bloc or else where, find a mentor who will spend the time with you to help you learn.</p>
